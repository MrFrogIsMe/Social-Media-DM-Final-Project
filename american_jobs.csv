Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (40 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!"

Amazon,Applied Scientist II,"Description

As part of the AWS Solutions organization, we have a vision to provide business applications, leveraging Amazon’s unique experience and expertise, that are used by millions of companies worldwide to manage day-to-day operations. We will accomplish this by accelerating our customers’ businesses through delivery of intuitive and differentiated technology solutions that solve enduring business challenges. We blend vision with curiosity and Amazon’s real-world experience to build opinionated, turnkey solutions. Where customers prefer to buy over build, we become their trusted partner with solutions that are no-brainers to buy and easy to use.

The Team: Amazon Go is a new kind of store with no lines and no checkout—you just grab and go! Customers simply use the Amazon Go app to enter the store, take what they want from our selection of fresh, delicious meals and grocery essentials, and go!

Our checkout-free shopping experience is made possible by our Just Walk Out Technology, which automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a virtual cart. When you’re done shopping, you can just leave the store. Shortly after, we’ll charge your Amazon account and send you a receipt. Check it out at amazon.com/go. Designed and custom-built by Amazonians, our Just Walk Out Technology uses a variety of technologies including computer vision, sensor fusion, and advanced machine learning.

As a Machine Learning or Computer Vision Research Scientist, you will help solve a variety of technical challenges and mentor other engineers. You will tackle challenging, novel situations every day and given the size of this initiative, you’ll have the opportunity to work with multiple technical teams at Amazon in different locations. You should be comfortable with a degree of ambiguity that’s higher than most projects and relish the idea of solving problems that, frankly, haven’t been solved at scale before - anywhere. Along the way, we guarantee that you’ll learn a ton, have fun and make a positive impact on millions of people.

People sometimes use it as a build farm on a shared server, for example.

Expertise in modern C++ development
Experience with software testing and test-driven development

What we offer you

We consider geographical location, experience, and performance in shaping compensation worldwide.

We provide all team members with additional benefits, which reflect our values and ideals. We balance our programs to meet local needs and ensure fairness globally.

Cube,Principal Software Engineer (Database Engineering),"About Cube Dev

At Cube we are building a technology stack for modern analytics. If you are fascinated by the software that powers large technology companies but want the challenges and freedom that come with working in a small startup, then the job at Cube is for you. We are a small and dedicated team in San Francisco, funded by top-tier SV investors, working on making advanced analytics infrastructure developed at large tech companies accessible to all developers around the world.

Position

As an engineer of the Cube Core team, your main goal will be to build and maintain various parts of open-source Cube Core (https://github.com/cube-js/cube.js), community support in our Slack, as well as development of Cube Cloud product.

Some Of The Problems You’ll Be Working On

SQL generation and rewriting. Cube is a simple yet powerful way to organize SQL queries. The Cube way is to generate the best possible SQL query for a given database while abstracting all complex stuff from users and giving them full power of SQL at the same time. To solve this problem, Cube parses SQL queries written by users to understand the structure and rewrites them to apply performance optimizations.
Cube Store. Cube Store is used to serve analytics for trillions of data points with sub-second response times. To keep up-to-date with growing big data demands and serving speeds we’re developing our own database optimized for serving huge aggregated tables with latencies of several milliseconds.
Cube APM. One of the main tech problems for Cube Cloud is to provide APM analytics of Cube instances using Cube itself. Being purely a dog food problem, large-scale real-time analytics has a lot of challenges, most of which will be solved for the first time ever using the SQL approach.

Requirements

Expert in database algorithms and data structures: columnar vs row storage, SQL parsing, query planning, indexes, partitioning, join algorithms, filter pushdown optimizations, HLL.
Expert in Rust, or any other low-level language.
Good communication skills.
Fluent English.
Previous startup experience or interest in working in a small fast-moving company.

Bonus Points

Expert in data structures and data processing algorithms.

Ensure Multipass is easy and intuitive to use
Architect new features and design the user experience

We provide all team members with additional benefits, which reflect our values and ideals. We balance our programs to meet local needs and ensure fairness globally.

Distributed work environment with twice-yearly team sprints in person
Personal learning and development budget of USD 2,000 per year

MongoDB,"Senior Software Engineer, Code Generation","MongoDB’s mission is to empower innovators to create, transform, and disrupt industries by unleashing the power of software and data. We enable organizations of all sizes to easily build, scale, and run modern applications by helping them modernize legacy workloads, embrace innovation, and unleash AI. Our industry-leading developer data platform, MongoDB Atlas, is the only globally distributed, multi-cloud database and is available in more than 115 regions across AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. Atlas allows customers to build and run applications anywhere—on premises, or across cloud providers. With offices worldwide and over 175,000 new developers signing up to use MongoDB every month, it’s no wonder that leading organizations, like Samsung and Toyota, trust MongoDB to build next-generation, AI-powered applications.

MongoDB is seeking a Senior Software Engineer with advanced software engineering skills and experience in code modernization & building tools that can traverse code structures programmatically. Joining this team, you'll be pivotal in a product engineering group dedicated to helping users navigate code conversion challenges with AI's support.

We are seeking candidates located in North America for in-office, remote, or hybrid work options.

Many organizations have built up large estates of legacy applications. Lack of scalability and resilience, long development times, operating costs, and inability to run on the cloud are common issues with these applications. To address these issues, organizations are engaging in large transformational Application Modernization programs. MongoDB is recognized as the developer data platform of choice for transactional systems that provide the best scalability, resiliency, and developer experience in the cloud and on-premises. Organizations continuously migrate workloads from these legacy applications to new platforms, often based on microservices, using MongoDB.

Such transformations are very time-intensive and often risky. MongoDB is bolstering its team by creating tools that guide customers in transitioning their applications from relational databases to MongoDB. As businesses evolve their application development frameworks, they're increasingly drawn to the versatility of the document model. The Application Modernization team, already instrumental in this area, aids developers in making the shift from relational databases to MongoDB via Relational Migrator. Now, they're broadening their toolkit and are keen on modernizing code using a mix of AI and traditional text processing.

Our ideal candidate will have

5+ years of experience in JAVA in building large-scale enterprise applications
Proficiency in Javascript and familiarity with common database access patterns and frameworks in one or more languages
Knowledge of enterprise-scale software architectures, application development methodologies, and software deployment and operations
Experience developing enterprise applications using relational databases and employing SQL and stored procedures with Oracle, MS SQL Server, Sybase and/or PostgreSQL databases
Experience in using and developing with MongoDB and JSON-based Document models is highly desirable
Experience with tools and methodologies for code analysis, refactoring, and automated testing
Problem-solving skills, including collaborating across disciplines and teams to devise creative solutions to technical and business challenges
Willingness to dive into a complex domain, ask the right questions, and bring new software tools and technologies to solve customer problems
Excellent communication skills (both spoken and written), within the team and in customer meetings
A good understanding of Generative AI concepts, tools, and services is a big plus, as is any experience building new applications/tools using Generative AI
A strong interest in how AI-supported toolchains can improve application development

Position Expectations

Execute a comprehensive code modernisation strategy that aligns transitioned code with cutting-edge practices
Design and optimise sophisticated code parsers to transform legacy code structures using techniques such as AST, into standardised formats
Collaborate with stakeholders to define and implement a code modernisation strategy, ensuring that transformed code aligns with modern software practices while preserving original functionality
Develop and maintain a robust code parser to accurately interpret legacy code structures and convert them into a standardised format like an abstract syntax tree (AST)
Provide thought leadership to the engineering team on using emerging technologies, frameworks and approaches to solve different problems
Collaborate closely with product managers and other engineers to understand business priorities and propose new solutions
Contribute and maintain the high quality of the codebase with tests that provide a high level of functional coverage and non-functional aspects with load testing, unit testing, integration testing, etc.
Share your knowledge by giving brown bags, tech talks, and evangelizing appropriate tech and engineering best practices
Define and improve business & product metrics to optimize the quality and cost of AI usage

Success Measures

Within the first three months, you will have:

Familiarise yourself with the MongoDB database and aggregation language
Familiarise yourself with the problem space and the domain
Set up software development infrastructure (tech stack, build tools, etc) to enable development using the relevant tech stacks
Started collaborating with your peers and contributed to code reviews

Within six months, you will have:

Care deeply about what you do and about making commerce better for everyone
Excel by seeking professional and personal hypergrowth
Keep up with an unrelenting pace (the week, not the quarter)
Be resilient and resourceful in face of ambiguity and thrive on (rather than endure) change
Bring critical thought and opinion
Embrace differences and disagreement to get shit done and move forward
Work digital-first for your daily work
