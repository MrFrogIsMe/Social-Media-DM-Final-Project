- applying to jobs immediately (filtering for past 24 hours postings everyday)

Are good software engineering practices sometimes at odds with job security?,"For example, avoiding tribal knowledge. You want all important details to be written somewhere so that no one needs to ask you. 

Automated tests, so that if someone breaks your code, they'll know where and why it broke without you having to tell them.

I had always assumed that making yourself unessential was a good thing because then it frees you up to work on bigger goals.

But in practice, this is not what I've seen. What I've seen in practice is that all managers really care about is how easy you are to replace. 

From personal anecdote I've seen older software engineers seem to understand this better and aren't as eager to make themselves redundant.

"Feeling Stuck and Lost: 4 Years of Experience, Former Amazon Engineer, but Can't Land a Job After a Year Off for Family","I’m in a very tough spot, and I could really use some guidance or words of wisdom from anyone who’s been through something similar. I’ve been grinding hard for months now—applying to jobs, prepping for interviews, trying everything I can to get back on track—but things just aren’t clicking.

Here’s some context: I’m a software engineer with about 4 years of experience. I’ve worked at companies like Amazon, and before that, I was in finance. My resume isn’t bad—I’ve led projects, worked with machine learning and scalable systems, done front-end and back-end dev, and even worked internationally. But despite all this, I’m barely getting interviews, and when I do, I end up rejected after what seemed like good recruiter conversations. It’s crushing.

The hardest part? I had to leave my job at Amazon about a year ago because my father was diagnosed with stomach cancer. I went overseas to care for him, and thankfully, he’s doing better now. But I’ve been job hunting for 6-7 months, and nothing seems to be working. It’s getting extremely depressing, and I’m terrified I’ll never find a new job.

I’ve shifted my focus to startups and YC companies because big tech feels like it only wants the “perfect candidate”—Harvard PhDs or people with a flawless, uninterrupted career path. But even the startups seem to want senior-level folks with a laundry list of experience for entry-level pay. It feels impossible to break in again.

And as if that wasn’t enough, I keep seeing articles about AI taking over jobs. I get it—we’re not there yet—but missing a year of work, dealing with personal responsibilities, and then seeing nothing but closed doors when I try to get back has left me feeling desperate and unsure of what to do next. Fortunately I have some more runway but NOT much left and it's getting scary. After having not worked for a year, seeing my peers and friends succeeding, it's hurting my ego and just making me depressed every single day.

Has anyone been through something like this? How did you keep pushing forward when it felt like everything was stacked against you? Any advice or guidance would mean the world to me right now.

Thanks in advance.

  
EDIT: 2 years finance experience, 4 years SWE experience, 1 year and 1 month of that was Amazon. The other years was at 2 different companies. You may ask why the hopping but for the 2nd job I had, there were layoffs which is why I then joined Amazon.

Engineers opinion regarding AI development is needed,"Yesterday another CEO (this time it was Mark Zuckerberg) said that AI would become capable of doing work of software engineers. In his opinion, starting this year we'll get ""AI that can effectively be a sort of midlevel engineer that you have at your company that can write code"". Personally, I don't believe it to be true as I worked with several LLM models and as far as I can tell they are far away from being ready to be called 'mid-level engineer'. But this is me speaking against Zukerberg. So it got me thinking. 

Most of the time when someone telling that ""AI will be able to replace developers"" its either some AI driven company CEO or marketing person, or it is some people very distant from software development, who tried it, managed to create a custom to-do list and now thinking that we are all cooked. But I doubt we can trust these opinions completely. 

So what do real engineers think? Are there any relevant and solid comments regarding the AI situation and progress from guys with experience in the field: actual senior or mid-level developers, those who do the coding and not the talking? Can you point me in the right direction where to look? 

Two reasons I am writing this. First, I need some experts opinion to show those who are learning or in the beginning of their career that everything is not that bad as it may seem. Second, I don't want to live inside a bubble. So I am trying to listen to different opinions and right now I see that the engineers opinions are missing from the picture.

"How do I ""disconnect"" from a client?","2 years ago I was hired by my current employer as a Senior Cybersecurity Architect, to work on a single project for a single client. That project will start to wind down then complete in 3-6 months and I'll start working with new clients. 


My problem isan emotional one. I'm far closer to my client's team than anyone at my employer. I meet with the client's staff 8+ times a week, work from their office (willingly) every week, hang out outside of work with our better halves. My employer on the other hand has me full ""WFH or any of the few dozen countries we have an office in"" and my work mates are solid but I see them in person once a month at most and there's a clear distinction between one group being work mates and the other messaging my phone for wedding photos the day I got married.

Almost all work friendships fizzle out within a year of the business relationship ending, I'm no stranger to that. Plus this project is a lot bigger than any other single point on my resume, it's a huge sense of pride. The client has tried to poach me but they can't match the pay, benefits, or career advancements, plus I'd serve the project better from where I am now.

And he's right. I've been doing engineering for 4ish years, and the 15 years of tech work before have been useful but don't really mesh with how they define senior engineers at his company.

So in all I'm pretty grateful. He says he'll go to bat and argue why an exception makes sense. But he could have said nothing. Brought me on to contract for 6 months then just shrugged when HR denied a full time offer.

Need advice for future job hunting - New Grad,"Hello everyone! 

I'm a Computer Science CO '24 student, us citizen, who has been looking for a job since around August, and wanted to get some advice regarding how to proceed.

In terms of experience, I had 1 internship in 2022 and another one right after graduation, but wasn't able to receive a return offer, as the second company didn't have an intern conversion program. I also have 3 college organizations listed on my resume where I worked with web development, and 3 projects listed on my resume.

I've applied to around 180-200 jobs: not that much compared to many people, I know, but I feel like it's genuinely difficult to even find jobs that I can apply for in the first place. Out of those, I had two final interviews, both which I did well on but was not selected. Now in 2025 I feel as if my status as a New Grad is rapidly vanishing and I need to overhaul my efforts at applying for a job.

Here's what I'm planning to do to try and secure any Tech-related job in the near future:

1. Acquire an AWS certificate (CPP, and maybe SAA if I gain more experience with AWS)

2. Apply to more government jobs (hell, jobs in general)

3. Work on newer personal projects and remove some older ones from the resume.

4. Maybe create a second resume I could use to tailor myself towards IT as well and get an A+ or Network+ certification if possible? Not sure if this is a good idea, because I don't have any IT experience.

Being put on a PIP 2 months after my Father died,"You heard that right, my father passed away in early November and I basically had to return to work 2 weeks later of those 2 weeks I was only paid 5 of those days for compassionate leave. So I had to force myself back into work while grieving. My performance took a nose dive as I honestly was not ready to continue working but had no holiday left nor could go on unpaid leave as I have bills to pay. So, from the last few weeks of November till end of December my performance wasn’t good, I couldn’t focus and the fact is no one really messaged me or spoke to me when I got back. No one said anything during the standup when I came back despite knowing what had happened. The only people that said anything to me was via a teams message which was from 1 senior dev and the head of QA which were appreciated. I just felt horrible and now coming into the new year 6th Jan I was put on a PIP. I couldn’t believe it. I’m looking for another job and will leave this place as soon as I can. This post is more to vent than anything just frustrated. Thanks for reading my misery.

How to land a web dev job from a degreeless Senior Engineer's perspective,"I've seen so many posts across all social media about how terrible the CS job market is right now. I can't speak for compiled applications positions but from a web development perspective it has never been easier [ *scratch that*, I should have said ""simpler"" ] to get a job. Notice how I didn't say it'd be fast? 

I've hired multiple people, owned my own development company, and led multiple projects as an employee. From the role of a hiring manager I can tell you that we absolutely positively do not care at all what your GPA was/is, what clubs you were in, or what your hobbies are. We care if you can achieve results. To further that point, I personally ( as do many of my peers ) not even care if you have a degree. I don't care if you can write a sorting algorithm with me watching over your shoulder because, guess what, that's not how we code in the real world. Use books, use Google, use ChatGPT. This field lives and dies on ""Get it done well and get it done fast"". How you do it is totally irrelevant. It's OK to ask for help and it's expected. 

So, if you're trying to get hired in 2025 here is my advice:

1. Trim your resumes way down to only reflect the absolutely most relevant information


2. Start a portfolio yesterday. Build things. It doesn't matter if they suck as long as they work. Now read that again. 


3. Ask EVERY. SINGLE. PERSON. you know if you can build something for them that'll bring value to them. Then put that in your portfolio. 


4. Stop getting degrees / certs in super oversaturated languages. Every person is coming out of college knowing Python. Pick an older language. Why older? Because tons of places still use old tech like PHP, Rails, etc. And guess what? It makes a lot of money because they need people to keep it alive. 


5. Quit applying to FAANG. Point blank...you aren't going to get hired. Instead, apply to non tech companies that need tech workers. Example: I was a Senior Full Stack Engineer for a commercial construction company. Six figure salary easy and in a rural state. 


6. Look local if possible. You can cut down on the competition IMMENSELY if you suck it up and take a work from office job local to your town / state. ( At least until you get a title and years under your belt )


7. If a company doesn't have their salary posted, it's probably a waste of time


8. If a company says you'll have more than 3 rounds of interviews...it's a waste of time. 


Remember, Actual completed projects are always better than what you say you know. 

And speaking of what you know..that's even less important than WHO you know. Make connections and make them often. Almost every job I've had, I've gotten because of someone I knew. 

That's my advice as a grumpy senior dev. If anyone has any questions, I'll do what I can to answer them as long as I don't get too bored. I genuinely do wish you all the best of luck though.

"This is the perfect time to start a business, instead of looking for a job","# DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT SELLING YOU ANYTHING. JUST HELPING.

I would like to talk about an alternative approach to the bad job market.

**I honestly think it is MUCH easier to build a business vs grinding leetcode and sending a billions job applications.**

I've done it multiple times and I'd like to offer everyone interested some help.

# ABOUT ME

I've never worked as a programmer in a company. I don't have a CS degree. I've never attended a bootcamp.

I am proof that ANYONE can learn this and build something.

I started learning at 25 and now, after 10 years and 10+ products, I can confidently tell you what works, and what doesn't... So you don't waste time and learn all of this in record time.

# BUILD BORING SHIT

This is the secret to making money. Businesses are **HUNGRY** for solutions to their everyday problems and they have nowhere to go.

Every developer is competing for the same FAANG jobs, and no one services the local businesses. Trust me, it is insane what they will tolerate.

To work at a company, you need to know a ton of tech, do politics, attend boring ass meetings, and beat 1,000 other applicants.

On the other hand, if you service local businesses, you can take a giant shit on the CEO's desk as long as you are helping him make more/save more money.

Your solutions don't even have to be anything special. The businesses are so desperate, they will be happy even with a mediocre solution.

NO ONE is offering them solutions, it is kind of amazing, you will have zero competition.

# FOCUS ON THE PROBLEM

If you follow this mantra, you will build great things. Do not try to come up with a smart solution and then sell it. Try to find what businesses struggle with, and then solve that problem. THEN you can sell that solution.

Problems are everywhere around you, you just have to listen carefully.

    Someone can say something mundane as ""Damn, I am so tired, I stayed late at work..."".
    
    Instead of saying ""Wow, that sucks..."", as ""Why? What made you work extra?"".
    
    They will say ""Man, I had to manually type in all this data"".
    
    You can then say ""Hmmm... I wonder if that can be automated...""
    
    Ask if you can have a look at the problem, or talk to some manager. Say that you can help them out.

The more boring the problem, the more interested they will be.

# IT'S ACTUALLY EASY

An amazing thing about building your own solutions is the freedom. You can build whatever you want, with no manager slowing you down. You are also free to choose the tech, so you are not forced to use shit tech like React, ORMs, Mongo etc... They client doesn't give 2 shits what your stack is.

This allows you to use really simple technologies to achieve the goal, instead of spending most of your time wrestling with tooling and needles complexities that you would encounter if you worked somewhere as a programmer.

# I CREATED A FREE GUIDE

I wrote a step-by-step guide and explained how everything works in order to build an app so you can start building solutions as soon as possible.

You can find it here: https://codepreneuring.com

Also, I have a 20 min talk on the same topic: https://youtu.be/YrRkAWDcMBE?si=zsfnTUA75JjWvhKp

I also plan to create Youtbe videos on various practical topics that most beginners struggle with. You can suggest some ideas what gives you the most trouble.

Should I Focus on Backend or Frontend Development as a Fresh Graduate?,"Up until now, in my university projects, I have only created desktop and CLI apps that handle a single user at a time. During this winter break, I decided to create a web app to learn how to build applications that handle multiple users. I also wanted to integrate the ML models I studied last summer. After researching, I took advice from GPT, which suggested learning FastAPI and React.js.

I recently completed a guided tutorial on FastAPI and explored the backend roadmap on roadmap.sh. I realized that I already know some of the concepts listed there, which sparked my interest in backend development. When I shared this with a friend, he mentioned that companies rarely hire fresh graduates as backend developers. Now, I’m wondering if I should continue focusing on backend development or shift my attention to frontend instead.

What do you think?

* Build real projects you can show off. Make something useful that solves a problem.
* Apply to jobs even if you don't feel 100% qualified.
* Intern at smaller companies since they're more open to hire new devs

My true CS story and a word of caution to those pursuing it,"I have a degree in computer engineering from a T25 with 2 internships.  My career progression has gone unpaid, 13/hr no benefits, 26/hr, 20/hr no benefits, 34/hr but now on track for layoff.  I'm 33 and only have 5 years of real work exp.  I have lived at home and lived cheap the entire time but yet haven't saved as much as my parents have spent supporting me to get here.  I've only just now cracked the 200K barrier but they have prob spent more like 300K to get me here. I have never been on a vacation or traveled, I get 6 days off per year, and my idea of eating out is a McDonalds McChicken with a free large fry loss leader coupon.  And again, I work from 9AM to 3AM multiple times a month.  

I am almost fully sedentary and asocial, and have developed late onset autism and schizophrenia due to the high cognitive load and stress of pursuing this career path.  At age 33, I'm setting aside the idea of ever starting a family or likely ever having real estate. 

After this layoff, due to a severe lack of jobs in my field for the foreseeable future, I will likely be looking at pivoting back to the same basic labor I could have done straight out of high school anyway and skipped all the costs and time waste of higher Ed.  It will likely pay somewhere in the $16-20/hr range for backbreaking work that I would have preferred to get out of the way when younger, and I will be shackled to living with family for the rest of my life. 

Due to the lowering of my testosterone and vocal ability (nothing to talk about combined with weakened vocal cords, since I'm at a computer mostly silent all day every day) due to having a sedentary computer job, most people find me socially repulsive and strongly dislike me within a few seconds of interaction.  I am frequently bullied even as an adult, and have even received physical threats verbally as well as direct threatening physical contact from coworkers.  This happens both in the workplace and when attempting to socialize.  I am friendly to everyone I come into contact with, but this is usually met with aggression.  

This is what STEM higher Ed study path sowed me.

I believe this is a realistic and common outcome of pursuing STEM as a career path.  Out of the dozen people I can think of that I've kept up with after schooling, only one other person has found a job paying above the 60K range.  Many of them never found anything and had to work 60-70 hours at a service level job or basic labor job to pay back their student loans, often while still living at home or with many roommates.  Only one of them has been able to start a family. I'm actually a success story compared to most of my peers because I didn't have the student loan debt. 

When doing simple searches for various STEM job postings on Indeed or LinkedIn etc  in my geographic area, over time I have noticed there are only a handful of applicable college-level jobs for STEM (or business, or humanities) grads every year, but there are known to be well more than 15,000 college graduates every year in the area. I would say the number is generously 2000 jobs for every 15,000 grads.  This is a trend I have been noticing since honestly 2008, as I frequently scroll job boards in my spare time.  The statistics that I have recorded for myself are wildly out of line with what is actually usually reported from the BLS and from higher Ed organizations.  

I recommend to do real data taking over your geographic region and seeing for yourself what you really think.  I think we are massively overvaluing the college degree currently and putting too much focus and time waste into it for our youth, leading to a detriment of their life outcome.

"for more experienced devs, is it better to be a jack of all trades, or a master of one? and is it feasible to be both? ","I’m 22 and in my last year of IT. I’ve completed about 18 freelance projects so far and worked for a company for six months on a contract to develop some things for them. I’m working as a full-stack developer using SQL, MERN, Next.js, and PHP. I’ve deployed projects on AWS, mostly using EC2 instances for hosting websites. I’m extremely good at frontend development and decent at backend development, though I can definitely improve. I’m also working on gaining more DevOps skills.

I have a small background in security; I took six months of courses on securing servers and web application penetration testing. I’ve also completed numerous web scraping and automation projects using Python. I’m really good at JavaScript, React and CSS a weird flex with CSS, but I’ve been able to recreate a ton of things with minimal Googling or AI assistance. It’s about 90% me writing the code. I’m also really good at finding bugs in full-stack projects; all my classmates would call me for help whenever they faced any CSS, JS, or full-stack-related issues.

Now, I’m trying to learn something more challenging, like C or C++, and create a complex project with it—maybe a game or a chess engine.

My current goal is to become a better full-stack web developer by significantly improving my backend skills, building a solid foundation in DevOps, and gaining more experience with it, if feasible. Additionally, I want to specialize in a specific field of cybersecurity, primarily securing servers or web applications.

The thing is, I believe web developers aren’t as respected as other developers, and I think there will be a lot of money to be made in other fields in the future. The problem is that I have no idea where to start or what to focus on to truly master. I feel like I’m spreading myself too thin.

I think fintech is great the money is great and I’m very passionate about software and coding in general, so let’s ignore the passion part.

Why are software jobs so incredibly unregulated?,"Part of the answer is that this is a relatively new career and some jobs don't actually require a degree but there are so many that build systems that handle money, run on airplanes and cars, power critical infrastructure, etc. But compared to jobs in law and medicine where degrees are obligatory or those in engineering where they are all but required as well CS is a wild west of people with questionble qualifications.

Small issue regarding internship and graduation,"Basically, I was originally supposed to graduate December 2025. I applied for JPMC SWE Internship through the CFG hackathon in the fall for the summer 2025 and got accepted around October.

I very recently had to make some changes to my degree as well as my graduation schedule so I will actually be graduating in May 2025 instead.

Onboarding doesnt start until late March, how likely would the recruiters rescind my internship if I email them right now about my graduation changes but still showing enthusiasm about participating in their SWE program.

Idk if this means much but imo, I made a really good impression at the hackathon as well.

I talked to a school career advisor and here is what they told me:

**""Definitely disclose your updated academic timeline to the employer; sooner is always better than later**

* **Go ahead and send an email to the recruiter (whoever you've been in contact with) and let them know that you want to “update” them on your educational timeline**
* **Advisor B affirmed that this is a good opportunity to re-emphasize your excitement. Additionally, you may want to express that you would be open to a longer-term role in the emerging talent software engineering program (linked below).**

**Advisor B also affirmed what I said yesterday in regards to this being a small adjustment that shouldn't cause you any issues since you did nothing wrong.""**

I guess I also wanted to know your opinions and was wondering if you guys have been in this situation or know of anyone who has been in a similar situation.

I dont have any other offers right now and yes, I'll obviously start applying for full time roles but it would be nice to have this as a backup until I find a better job.",small issue regarding internship graduation,basically originally supposed graduate december applied jpmc swe internship cfg hackathon fall summer got accepted around october recently make changes degree well graduation schedule actually graduating may instead onboarding doesnt start late march likely would recruiters rescind internship email right graduation changes still showing enthusiasm participating swe program idk means much imo made really good impression hackathon well talked school career advisor told definitely disclose updated academic timeline employer sooner always better later go ahead send email recruiter whoever youve contact let know want update educational timeline advisor b affirmed good opportunity reemphasize excitement additionally may want express would open longerterm role emerging talent software engineering program linked advisor b also affirmed said yesterday regards small adjustment shouldnt cause issues since nothing wrong guess also wanted know opinions wondering guys situation know anyone similar situation dont offers right yes ill obviously start applying full time roles would nice backup find better job,0.0,0.9856,positive,"['accepted', 'well', 'enthusiasm', 'good', 'impression', 'well', 'definitely', 'better', 'want', 'good', 'opportunity', 'excitement', 'want', 'talent', 'yes', 'nice', 'better']","['idk', 'wrong', 'ill']"
Considering a Move from Germany to the Bay Area as a Senior ML Engineer – Seeking Advice,"

Hi everyone,

I’m currently working as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer Consultant at AWS, based in Germany. My role involves leading ML projects for large international customer (mainly global corporations) and working hands-on, particularly with GenAI and other advanced ML solutions. 

Recently, I’ve been seriously considering a move to the Bay Area, driven by a combination of career growth and financial opportunity. After discussing with colleagues in the US, it seems that my skills and experience could command at least 2.5 to 3 times my current salary, which is a major factor. Beyond that, I believe working in the Bay Area could expose me to an even more innovative environment and help me push my career to the next level. I have a wife and also a child. (<5y)

I’d love to hear your thoughts:
	•	For those who’ve made a similar move, what was your experience like?
	•	How realistic is it to make such a transition, especially regarding visa sponsorship?
	•	What should I be aware of in terms of cost of living, work culture, and lifestyle changes?
	•	Are there specific companies, industries, or resources you’d recommend for someone with my profile in the Bay Area?

I’m excited about the possibilities but want to make sure I have a clear understanding of what to expect. Any advice, insights, or personal stories would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance for your input!

Am I pigeonholing myself into strictly data analysis positions or can I use the experience towards more development central positions in the future? ,"I accepted a position today as a data analyst for a local company because I need a consistent paycheck. This is the second job that I have had that is labeled as data analyst and/or IT. I am happy nonetheless because finding work has been difficult lately, but I am worried that I am setting myself up to be stuck in something I do for money and not passion.

The first big project I worked on ignited a passion in me that lead me to change careers. During my time taking prerequisite courses to pursue an additional masters (working towards now), I have been fortunate enough to work on a full stack project for a wholesale distribution side of a catering company. The problem is that I haven’t had work in any sort of development since then.

Am I in an odd position going forward? Should these positions be something I list on a resume, and if so should I be framing them in a certain light?

Struggling to Find a New Position: Seeking Advice on What I Might Be Missing,"Hi everyone

I’m currently facing challenges in my job search, and I’d like your input on what might be holding me back. Here’s some context about my background and experience:

I’ve held leadership roles, including Executive Director, Director of Sales and Marketing, and Regional Manager, where I consistently delivered exceptional results, such as improving gross margins, negotiating significant supplier savings, and leading high-performing teams. My skills include strategic vision, sales growth, and operational optimization. I also had roles such as project manager, product owner (not official roles but part of sub roles) and implementation manager.

Despite this track record, I’m finding it difficult to secure a new position. I’ve updated my resume, tailored applications to roles, and leveraged my network, but responses have been minimal.

I feel that the job market is somehow packed and that unless you have good connection it's becoming a lot harder to land jobs... (I'm from Canada and I apply in Canada as well as in the US) 

Also I do feel that being a ""jack of all trade"" is less attractive as I worked in SaaS, Eyewear retail and ERP world holding multiple position which maybe is seen as more volatile ???

Any advices ?

In October, I got a FAANG interview and landed a SWE Intern offer in November.

I immediately contacted my defense recruiter and tried to get my internship moved to off-season (FAANG didn't have this option), but she said it wasn't possible. I explained how difficult of a decision it was and how deeply sorry I was and reneged my defense offer.

It's 2 months later now, and I'd like to announce my FAANG internship on LinkedIn, etc. so that I can connect with other interns, find roommates, etc. However, I'm still connected with a lot of FT employees from the defense contractor due to the event, and I'm anxious about them somehow retaliating and calling the FAANG and letting them know that I had formerly reneged. Is this even a possibility, or am I just being anxious for no reason?

A not so popular “hack” for job searching,"Hey everyone,

I want to tell you about a “hack” for increasing one’s chances of getting an interview. Most people on reddit are focusing on tailoring resumes to pass ATS systems or using AI tools to generate cover letters or even bots that automatically apply to jobs for you. While all of these are useful, there’s one thing most people don’t even think about.

I guess most of you are aware at this point that most jobs get hundreds of applications nowadays. After filtering out the irrelevant ones, recruiters then go over the valid resumes and call people up for interviews. But here is the trick, they go over applicants in order, so if your resume is the last in the pile, chances are they are going to hire someone before even reading yours.

This means it’s important to apply to jobs as soon as they are posted. Most job boards (linkedin, indeed, dice etc) have filters that can display only jobs posted in the last 24h. Use that to make sure your resume is amongst the first ones in the pile.

Now don’t get me wrong, not all recruiters do it like this, but for those that do, this method actually works. How can I be sure? I’m working on an open source tool built around this idea. It aggregates jobs from 10+ job boards and sends email notifications when new jobs are posted so you can stay ahead of the competition.

Here is the link to the github project [https://github.com/beastx-ro/first2apply](https://github.com/beastx-ro/first2apply)

Before I get downvoted into oblivion: the tool also has a comercial version, I only made it open source recently. But seeing how this is a dev sub, I’m sure most of you can figure out how to run it locally.

What do people think about what Mark said? I’m a junior developer myself and have used LLMs (Large Language Models). I’ve read about many experienced developers who also use LLMs and can create a great product from scratch, as long as they have a solid understanding of development.

For example, if you’re a beginner, you can prompt an LLM with something simple like:  
*""Create this Product API for me.""*

If you have more experience, you can create more advanced prompts like:  
*""Create this Product API and include JWT and CORS.""*

Or if you’re working with SQL and forget the syntax:  
*""Make an aggregation for X so that it only returns Y result.""*

When it comes to frontend, whether it’s React or Vue.js, you can take a screenshot and prompt something like:  
*""I want this UI. Make it for me.""*

**Conclusion:** I can sense that there will be fewer and fewer hires of juniors/new graduates. Most companies will likely prefer hiring mid- or senior-level developers who have broad and solid knowledge and use LLMs to enhance their work and quickly deliver code so the product can hit the market faster.

P.S. Maybe now is a good time to create an MVP using LLMs and find an angel investor if the product has sales potential. There’s a Danish high school student who has done it, so perhaps we can follow in his footsteps.",rip junior future graduated dev mark said ai good mid dev opinion would like discuss yall,heres translated version english people think mark said im junior developer used llms large language models ive read many experienced developers also use llms create great product scratch long solid understanding development example youre beginner prompt llm something simple like create product api experience create advanced prompts like create product api include jwt cors youre working sql forget syntax make aggregation x returns result comes frontend whether react vuejs take screenshot prompt something like want ui make conclusion sense fewer fewer hires juniorsnew graduates companies likely prefer hiring mid seniorlevel developers broad solid knowledge use llms enhance work quickly deliver code product hit market faster ps maybe good time create mvp using llms find angel investor product sales potential theres danish high school student done perhaps follow footsteps,0.6597,0.9738,positive,"['create', 'great', 'solid', 'like', 'create', 'create', 'advanced', 'like', 'create', 'like', 'want', 'solid', 'good', 'create']",['forget']

How do I learn on a job with tight deadlines and unrealistic expectations?,"Background: I got hired in August at my first dev job as a junior dev, and this job is one of those 'fast paced environments' that is a standard 10hr day and drains you mentally - but it is a first job and bad job market so I've made my peace with that aspect for the time being and decided to tough it out.

However, my biggest concern is genuinely that I am not learning efficiently and I feel so stupid working here every day. I have been 6 stressful months into this job and while I have learned a lot, I am still given tasks everyday that I have no clue how to do.

For example, I will be given a task like ""Build this entire payment provider"". As soon as I get this ticket I am stressed and dreading it, because it will be given like a 3 hr 'estimate' (Sure it's an estimate but they get mad about overages and bring it up in quarterly reviews so I rarely log time over) and I know I am gonna have to find a way to build this thing out in their broken codebase that I still haven't wrapped my head around before the deadline for the ticket at the end of the sprint.

For me personally, I really need to break things down and isolate each part of it to understand/learn - but that feels unrealistic given the time estimates and the fact that I have tons of other tasks lined up in my sprint that I am confused about so I can't spend most of my day on one task allotted for 3hrs. So, what I end up doing is basically copying what I see in other places, reaching out to other devs for help, asking ChatGPT etc - whatever I can do to get the task done ASAP. Obviously while this tends to work, I am not learning by doing this and makes me feel more like a stressed out robot than a growing programmer.

What I used to do was get the tasks done during the workday, then spend hours after work studying what I did. However, this makes each day around a 14hr workday and just wasn't reasonable given that I was sacrificing the time I have for working out and taking care of myself to instead doing unpaid work.

So, how would you guys do it? Is this a matter of continuing to take the time to study after work?

TLDR: I can't seem to learn/work efficiently with unrealistic deadlines and expectations, and that is making me a worse programmer and stress out. So how do you guys do it?

An attempt of escaping academia at 30+,"Hi, 

I am not sure if this is allowed here, I am really just a bit desperate and looking for advice/opinion.

I mostly worked in academia and want to switch to data science in private sector in UK (or remote anywhere), but struggling to find a job in the field and start thinking it is due to me being hopeless.

So I am 34F, PhD in CS ( top10 UK uni), masters in maths in Russia (not as good uni though). My PhD was in computer vision with some data analysis and deep learning.

I worked in academia as a researcher (computer vision) and lecturing (maths,ds). Sometimes we collaborated with businesses.

I feel rather confident in python, ok with R, SQL, aws, have good knowledge in statistics, data analysis and machine learning. I also teach charltgpt courses as a volunteer.

I am applying for jobs (mostly via linkedin) but unfortunately not much has come up (applied for about 25, all that I thought I would fit into) and I only had one interview for a junior position that didn't go forward as they needed someone with more relevant experience.

So my questions really are:

1. Is it even possible with my initial conditions to do it?
2. If it is, what can I do to make myself a more desirable employee?
3. Are there any other roles that I can look into apart from DS that I am overlooking?
4. Does it make sense to lower my expectations and just start looking for internships?

"I’ve got a fantastic job, but I’m too dumb for it. What do I do?","Im a midlevel with 5 years of experience. I've been working for about half a year at this new company, it's a very big name (not quite FANG, but big splashy west coast tech), I'm paid VERY well, and I'm currently offered challenging work that's helping me grow.

It would all be great except I've been slowly realizing that I'm in over my head. It's like imposter syndrome but I'm actually really an imposter!

I do okay with the technical stuff; frankly not as good as I should be for 5 YOE but I'm growing fast and I feel good about that part. I can sure write some tidy, well-documented PRs that do what they say they do.

However, I struggle with... everything else. I'm given projects, and somehow I ALWAYS forget a detail... analytics, or communicating with another team that works in the area, or there's an edge case I missed, or it's hard for non-dev stakeholders to test, or there was a document I should have written. I really struggle with all the skills AROUND the actual coding.

Everyone works long hours, and I can't because I have a young family (my kid has been waking up every two hours a night for months now...) so I fall behind in that respect, too. This is a ""work hard and get the glory"" position, and I'm a ""do a reasonable amount of work, clock out on time, forget about work"" type. My boss is the political kind, he's definitely trying to make director, and he assumes everyone else is trying to make it big too. He tries to help me, but every meeting I have with him makes me so anxious because he's giving me advice for how to work in the middle of the night or on the weekend and I just can't leave my child alone.

If I can make it to a couple years here, I think my skills will grow massively and I can leverage that into a position that I'm a better fit for. I don't think I'm a terrible dev, but they openly state that they want the best talent in this job, and I'm not that. 

Two questions: how do I git gud at the non-coding aspect of the job?

Career advice - moving software engineering jobs for less money,"Asking for a friend as his Reddit doesn't have 100karma yet.

Hi everyone, bit of a long one but I was just hoping to get some career advice and input from you all.

I’m currently working as a fully remote (we don’t have an office) mid level software engineer in Australia for a medium sized US based company (still working AU hours as we have a small <20 person engineering team here down under). I’ve been here for about 3 years (started here as an associate) and have moved around different areas of the business so feel quite comfortable both with the people and with the tech stack here (React/Next frontend, node and AWS backend). The culture here is not bad but also not great. I won’t name the company but in the past couple of years, we’ve experienced numerous layoffs severely impacting both the headcount and morale. Stability wise I do think it’s getting better as we had new investors, repaid our debt and the new CEO and leadership team seems to have a strong people/tech focus. My direct manager is awesome and the team I work with is supportive whenever I reach out, although, I feel like most of them are checked out and jaded from the past several rounds of layoffs so I feel like they do the bare minimum on top of their day to day work (e.g. they don’t volunteer to do brown bag / lunch and learn sessions etc. but are willing to help out if you ask for help directly) and are just here for their pay check which I don’t blame them at all after everything we’ve gone through. So overall, I’d say the engineering culture is poor..

Recently, I’ve been offered another mid level engineering role at an Australian Digital Bank. It’s also a remote role with the option to come into the office whenever I want (will definitely come in more at the start to get settled in / make a good impression) but I do feel like they might change it to a hybrid structure and force people to come in (just a feeling based on how other Australian companies are treating their employees post Covid). The team I’ll be in will be working on a migration project so I’m not really sure what to expect there (some input here would be awesome). The tech stack for the backend is also quite different being Ruby on Rails and GCP (both of which I’ve never worked on). This does worry me a bit as I’ve mainly worked on the frontend and don’t have much backend experience so this might hinder my chances of getting promoted / getting a pay rise quickly. The culture and people seem pretty good from my interview experience and asking some friends of friends who work there, although they did mention that the culture is changing slightly as they are now in the scale up phase and growing quite large and quickly.

Now my uncertainty comes from (surprise, surprise) the pay… The new role will be paying an annual base salary $16k AUD less than my current company. They also don’t offer benefits such as health insurance, and internet, education and health and wellbeing (gym, sports etc.) reimbursements (the dollar equivalent of about $500 AUD/month or $6k AUD/yearly). On top of that, if I take the new role, I will miss out on my yearly bonus payout from my current company which I estimate to be around $10k AUD so all in all, about a $30k AUD remuneration difference. Also regarding the stability, as I have been working for around 3 years, if I do get laid off I should get a severance of about 3 months.

I would say I’m in the more junior side of my career as I’ve been a mid level for about 1.5 years. I value learning and growing my skills and currently, I feel like I can only do this on my own as like I mentioned above, everyone at my current company feels checked out so there’s not a great engineering or learning culture. I do feel like the people at the new role are much more optimistic and they put more effort into their engineering culture (e.g. they have mentoring programs, learning sessions and overall everyone seems less jaded lol). I understand that at the end of the day, I’ll learn the most from doing my own side projects but I feel like it would be good and nice to surround myself with more positive and eager engineers who like to share tech news, and interesting things they discover and are working on. 

One thing I have realised (and accepted) as well is that I don’t think any other AU company (with the exception of a couple of tech giants) will pay as much as my current company or provide as good of benefits as I joined when the market was hot and my awesome manager has always looked out for me throughout my time here. I have also tried negotiating the remuneration package and cannot delay my start date (to get my current bonus) for the new role.

So now I’m left heavily conflicted not knowing what to do. Should I make the jump and hopefully be surrounded by a new environment that can motivate me more or should I just ride out this current high paying gig which just lacks positive energy and can be depressing at times?

Why did we all fall for the CS degree scam?,"I've just started to realize just how useless this degree is now. Impossible to get a job. CS degrees don't teach you how to code, you're ""supposed"" to do that on your own. 

Companies don't care if you have a CS degree or not, they just care if you know how to code. I'm starting to realize why companies favored bootcamps back then, because if a bootcamp actually teach you how to code, it's more valuable than a CS degree. If it takes a CS grad 1 year to become productive, but a 4 month bootcamp grad is productive from day one, the bootcamp grad is more valuable.

There's a stupid amount of SWE's in FANG that don't have CS degrees. Why on earth did we fall for this scam? Why didn't we study electrical engineering or a ""regular"" engineering field.

Should I stay another year to double major in Statistics? (B.S. in Computer Science),"Hi all, this semester I will be graduating with a B.S. in CS.

Plus, the first few weeks are hectic: learning the business domain, understanding existing pipelines, and getting up to speed with the team’s workflow.

Balancing all that while also picking up new tools or technologies can feel overwhelming. So, how do you guys manage this?
	•	Do you focus on business knowledge first and pick up tools as you go?
	•	Or do you prioritize getting comfortable with the tech first?
	•	Any tips on making the transition smoother?

Would love to hear how you’ve handled this kind of challenge!",navigate changing jobs especially tech stack slightly different,hey everyone recently started thinking tricky change jobs company seems unique tech stack toolsstuff might used plus first weeks hectic learning business domain understanding existing pipelines getting speed teams workflow balancing also picking new tools technologies feel overwhelming guys manage focus business knowledge first pick tools go prioritize getting comfortable tech first tips making transition smoother would love hear youve handled kind challenge,0.0,0.891,positive,"['comfortable', 'love', 'kind', 'challenge']",['tricky']
28 Years Old - Background in CS but never worked in Tech,"Hey guys, I'm from the East Coast, USA, I got a bachelors in CS, due to health issues couldn't work for some years, then got hired as an assistant in a firm. Pay was good, work was easy so I took it easy. At some point, I realized that the job is a dead end and I also wished to go into tech (always enjoyed it). I thought of doing a Masters in CS (course based) and managed to get a scholarship at a public university. I've been doing my masters part-time while working but I am also 28 years old.

I'm looking at data-science related positions since some aspects of my job were related to data analysis and my Masters concentration is Machine Learning.

Completing Computer Science degree and getting into IT?,"Hi,

What would you do in my situation?

I’m currently in my second year at a decent university studying Computer Science. CS is fun, and I enjoy coding to some extent. I’m very skilled with computers, programs, and software, but I’ve realized I have a strong interest in management, especially since I worked as an Office Manager in the past and really enjoyed it. I decided to pursue a university degree while I’m still young (just turned 20) because I know how valuable it can be.

The problem is, the CS job market right now feels overwhelming. The competition is intense, and while I enjoy CS, I don’t have the same passion for it as others seem to. Personal projects, for example, aren’t my thing—not because I’m lazy, but because they don’t excite me. The idea of building a massive portfolio with elaborate projects, all while trying to keep up with my university work and aiming for decent grades, just feels exhausting. And then, after all that, there’s still a risk of being unemployed after sending out hundreds of job applications.

I also don’t want to spend months working unpaid internships, going from company to company, just for a slightly better shot at a job. The thought of needing internships, personal projects, and experience, all on top of a degree, feels like too much for me. I know my abilities and what I can do, but this path seems pointless for me.

That said, I don’t want to drop out, especially since I’ve only got a year and a half left. I feel like I can push through and finish the degree. However, I’ve been thinking about avoiding the ultra-competitive CS job market altogether and focusing on something more suited to me. IT feels like a natural fit, but I initially chose CS because I thought it would give me more options and lead to higher salaries. I regret that decision now.

Is it still possible to transition into IT after graduating? Or what are my other options?

Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated!

Thoughts on cold emailing in the age of AI? Things have changed these past few years and I want to know your thoughts.,"Hey everyone,

So I'm back on my job search grind these past few months, after not doing much for a year. I had a year long kick of going really hard at it a couple years ago, and I found that cold emailing was my greatest tool. All of my interviews came from cold emails. Back then I had a rough template that I'd replace certain words in or add/subtract a bit. I'd target pretty much anyone at the companies.

Fast forward to now where everyone is using AI. Now, I feel like all written communication has been cheapened. **If you type a nice message to someone in this context, they'll probably assume it's written by AI and you didn't put in that effort.** I've started up my applications again for the first time in a couple years a few days ago, and now I'm using AI to craft cold emails with ease.

I'm just wondering if you think cold emails are not considered as much anymore since they're now likely AI. These past few days I have been using it to craft my cold emails. The main issue I see with AI writes things like cold emails TOO perfectly. The thing is, it is still better than my old template and so much easier to tailor to the job description when I paste it in. I always read over each generated email carefully before I send it, adding or subtracting things from the suggestion as needed. It's great and has allowed me to send more emails and increased my efficiency overall.

As someone who would be willing to put in the effort to type cold emails but prefers my efficiency with AI, I feel like I'd probably just lose out if doing my old method because everyone is going to be suspicious of any correspondence now. I'm hoping that cold emails are still somewhat as effective as they once were and not disregarded completely.

Also, I never used to do cover letters but now I've been doing them for almost every application because I can easily generate, proofread, and edit something great. But those are probably cheapened as well.

  
What do y'all think? If you're a hiring manager or someone in the position to recieve cold emails, do you instantly assume everything is AI? I'm not using tools like Apollo to automate everything, I still do each one manually and put care into making sure it doesn't sound weird and accurately reflects my skills.

**If you're on this sub and haven't cold emailed before though, I recommend it more than anything. It increases your chances a lot and I landed several interviews through them in the past.**",thoughts cold emailing age ai things changed past years want know thoughts,hey everyone im back job search grind past months much year year long kick going really hard couple years ago found cold emailing greatest tool interviews came cold emails back rough template id replace certain words addsubtract bit id target pretty much anyone companies fast forward everyone using ai feel like written communication cheapened type nice message someone context theyll probably assume written ai didnt put effort ive started applications first time couple years days ago im using ai craft cold emails ease im wondering think cold emails considered much anymore since theyre likely ai past days using craft cold emails main issue see ai writes things like cold emails perfectly thing still better old template much easier tailor job description paste always read generated email carefully send adding subtracting things suggestion needed great allowed send emails increased efficiency overall someone would willing put effort type cold emails prefers efficiency ai feel like id probably lose old method everyone going suspicious correspondence im hoping cold emails still somewhat effective disregarded completely also never used cover letters ive almost every application easily generate proofread edit something great probably cheapened well yall think youre hiring manager someone position recieve cold emails instantly assume everything ai im using tools like apollo automate everything still one manually put care making sure doesnt sound weird accurately reflects skills youre sub havent cold emailed though recommend anything increases chances lot landed several interviews past,0.0772,0.9954,positive,"['greatest', 'certain', 'pretty', 'like', 'nice', 'ease', 'like', 'perfectly', 'better', 'easier', 'carefully', 'great', 'increased', 'efficiency', 'efficiency', 'like', 'hoping', 'effective', 'easily', 'great', 'well', 'like', 'care', 'sure', 'recommend', 'chances']","['hard', 'lose', 'suspicious', 'disregarded', 'weird']"
Should I switch from native mobile development to web development?,"I’ve been working as a developer for about three years now, with the last two focused on Android development. Over that time, I’ve worked hard to improve my skills—learning Kotlin, diving into different frameworks, and building portfolio projects. It’s been a good experience, and I’ve grown a lot.

That said, the market for native Android development feels pretty small, at least from what I’ve seen. I’ve gotten very few offers, and the ones I did get were mostly for backend or cross-platform mobile developer roles.

At my current job, I’ve also worked on a decent number of APIs—mostly maintenance—so I’ve got some experience with Spring Boot and Java. I’ve even had the occasional brush with JavaScript frameworks.

Now I’m thinking about shifting my focus. I’m torn between moving into cross-platform mobile development with Flutter or diving deeper into backend development with Spring Boot.

Do you think switching to backend development would mean starting over from scratch in the job market? Or would it be a good move given my background?

You'll Never Be The Perfect Applicant,"**Three fun facts about me:**

1. Ive been a professional developer for 10+ years
2. I've worked at 5 different companies (ranging from 10-person start ups to FAANG)
3. I've never been ""qualified"" for a job I was hired for

**What Do I Mean?**  
I’m not saying I tricked anyone into hiring me. Rather, if I look back at each job posting’s “requirements” versus my skills at the time, I was never a perfect match.

I currently run a website and weekly newsletter to help programmers build their tech careers. One of the biggest issues I see is people **rejecting themselves** before they even apply for a job. They’ll see postings that list:

* 3 years experience
* Experience with random\_react\_Library\_1
* Experience with random\_react\_Library\_2

They’ll think: “Well, I only have 1.5 years of experience and I only know library #1. Guess I’m out.” And they don’t apply.

**How Job Postings Really Work**  
A job listing usually describes the *perfect* candidate—someone with the right number of years, the exact tools, the ideal background. **In reality, that perfect candidate rarely applies, or may not even exist.** Companies often hire someone who has a good chunk of the requirements and shows a willingness to learn the rest.

Instead of rejecting yourself on the company’s behalf, submit your application. Let them decide if you’re missing something critical.

**A few caveats:**

**1. Be Realistic**  
I’m not saying to go wild and apply for senior machine learning roles if you’re a junior frontend dev. If a company is looking for a web developer and you match about 50–70% of the posting, go for it. That’s a realistic gamble worth taking.

**2. Become More of The Candidate They Want**  
You might match 60% of the requirements for a job and land an interview a week later. That’s a solid heads-up: you’ve got a description of their “perfect candidate.” Spend the days before your interview filling gaps in your knowledge. You don’t need to become an expert in Flask or Retrofit overnight, but at least learn the basics.

If they ask, “Have you used Flask before?” consider these two answers:

**Answer A:** “No, I’ve never used it.”  
**Answer B:** “No, I haven’t used it in a project yet, but I understand it’s a popular Python library for building APIs. My experience so far has been with pre-built APIs, but I’ve been excited to learn Flask.”

Which do you think sounds better?

**3. Find Commonalities in Listings**  
While you’re applying, pay attention to recurring skills you lack. If you see “Jetpack Compose” in 9 out of 10 Android job postings, that’s a hint. Spend your downtime learning Jetpack Compose. Job searching can take a long time, so use that time to keep improving your chances as a candidate.

**Conclusion**  
I hope this post helps. I originally began writing it for my dev newsletter, but I realized it might benefit the broader community. If you’ve been holding back on applying for jobs because you’re not a 100% match, go for it anyway. Let the company decide if you’re a fit—you might be surprised by the outcome.

And best of luck on your job search!

Clearance related contract work salary,Hey folks so I am more junior in the clearance jobs based field. I am not familiar with 10-99 roles being a subcontractor but recruiter told me they hire me on initially as a 10-99 meaning while the pay seems better they aren’t covering jack for benefits so I’m left for that on my own. The recruiter said the client will hire me as W2 about under half a year from hire. What happens when I go to W2 do they decrease my new annual salary by 20-30%? I guess I’m tryna see what’s up. I want to do a job hope obvs to make more money so I wouldn’t want to be put in a situation where I’m breaking even between my current job and the next.

Am I getting bamboozled? Private company offers RSUs with weird evaluation.,"I received an offer providing Double-trigger RSUs in private company. My understanding is this is usually based on the 409A evaluation, but after some prodding, they admitted to me it would be based on the most (fairly recent) Series D investor price instead of 409A.

My concern is that if they give me 200K worth of stock at the investor's price, then the FMV of those shares would actually be significantly less given the 409A.

Could it be because they haven't done a 409A and fast growth leads them to believe that the latest funding round is better representative of the FMV?",getting bamboozled private company offers rsus weird evaluation,received offer providing doubletrigger rsus private company understanding usually based evaluation prodding admitted would based fairly recent series investor price instead concern give k worth stock investors price fmv shares would actually significantly less given could havent done fast growth leads believe latest funding round better representative fmv,-0.4939,0.6388,positive,"['admitted', 'worth', 'shares', 'growth', 'better']",[]

Cooked Internship Search: to PhD or not to PhD.,"Hello beautiful people. I am a European NLP master student (not doing the master in my country) about to start a 6-month research internship in a research lab in the realm of applied AI for politics and economics. I was hoping to get an industry internship but I couldn't land any, which was rather disappointing. I think the primary reason was that I come from a linguistics background (BA + Technical Translation MA) and my internships are linguist positions. That being said, I am among the top of my class, I have started a CS Degree part-time (I really liked my CS classes and I LOVE programming) and I have two personal projects (continuation and improvements of research projects I had to do for class) that are lowkey interesting. I don't have any publications or any prior research experience.

This has left me a bit disheartened in terms of my future prospects: I was hoping to start working shortly after finishing the programme but if the internship search is anything to go by, I am rather COOKED. My ultimate goal would be to get a dynamic, interesting job in DA/DS/Applied Research outside of my country in a city with an international community. I am basically willing to go anywhere as long as I can afford a 1-bedroom apartment and not go broke or live paycheck to paycheck (not possible in my country).

Now, I know that the lab and my thesis supervisor are going to open up a PhD position that will be a sequel of my internship topic and he has all but offered it if the internship goes well. There is also a ERC project going on with another one of my supervisors which is nice. While it was not my initial plan, I am very tempted to try to take it if all goes well given that the alternative may be not finding a job, having to go back to my country (which I want to avoid at all costs) and probably having to get a low paying language-related job until I finish my CS Degree at least.

Pros:

\- I have liked working on the toy-research projects and I enjoy working in interdisciplinary teams (did a supervised project with an external department).

\- The research topic is a pretty good fit for me.

\- The PhD grant would allow me to live more or less comfortably and maybe even save up a little bit (based on my current budget in a slightly more expensive city).

\- The city I would be moving to is majestic, I truly think I'd love it there.

\- Obviously a PhD is a step up from a Master's.

Cons:

\- I don't know how prestigious/not prestigious the lab is.

\- Delaying entering the workforce by 3 years would not be ideal as my end goal is not going into academia.

\- If the stars aligned and I could start working right away, I would.

Would doing a PhD be worth it in my situation to achieve my goal eventually? Would it be valued by future employers? Would it give me an edge compared to potential candidates for a future DS job? Are there any PhD/lab red flags that I should specially look at while doing my internship? Do you see any other alternatives? Any other tips?

Moving to NY but compensation adjustment is unknown,"1YOE, 24M, MCOL (7% lower than national average), TC: $91k, FinTech

  
Currently working fully remote however RTO is expected within this year/next year. I just started last year in Jan and I've just finished switching from a maintenance team to a product team but with the caveat that I will have to move to NY in 2026 after this switch (If I stay on my current team, I will have to move to Charlotte in 2026). I wanted to switch teams because I felt as I wasn't learning much on the maintenance team and not advancing my career at all whereas the product team will be a new application that the team is building. I currently live with my partner, 2 dogs, and 2 cats.

My largest concern with moving to NY will be my compensation adjustment. I've spoken to the manager of my new team and they confirmed that I will be receiving an adjustment in terms of compensation however is unable to give me an exact number as it will be ""performance/merit based"" and likely will depend on my 2025 performance. I went online and checked some COL adjustment calculators and in order for me to maintain the same COL, I would need roughly a 60-70% raise and am worried that the compensation adjustment would not even be close to that number if even 20%.

Codecademy noob confusion about career,"So I began taking Codecademy’s Full-Stack Engineer career path a couple weeks ago. It’s great but now having spent 50 or so hours on it, I’m second-guessing whether I chose the right path.



My worrying stems from the following:

* Web development (which I understand to be HTML/CSS/JS but I’m sure there is more to it than my basic notion of it) seems like it’s the most vulnerable field of tech to becoming automated.
* Data science, as I understand it, requires business understanding, which humans can be better than computers at, so it seems like it’s less vulnerable to becoming automated.
* I don’t feel good about continuing to work on my curriculum because of my uncertainty - I don’t know if my current path is a waste of time.



So I have two questions that I hope someone can help me with:

* Am I wasting my time learning HTML/CSS in 2025 when I should be pursuing a different field like data science?
* Where is a good place that I can find experienced tech people to consult for career advice? A real human in-person person who lives near me who I can drive to, I mean. I tried emailing some CS professors at the university near me but no replies.

Joining series A vs Series B startup?,"Hello people!

I have got two offers - company A is a series A($20 million) startup providing 90% hike along with esops. They are in the AI security space and deal with enterprise clients(though they have only 3 atm). They have 19 investors. Established in 2022. Fully remote and is established in US. 
Employee strength is 45. 
As per employees, work pressure is expected and I'll be working directly under the CEO.


Company B is a series B startup providing 50% hike along with other benefits such as education reimbursement and own laptop. Also remote. They have 3 investors and raised total $35 million and established in 2019. They are in compliance space and have 1000s of clients but most of them are SMBs and startups.
Work pressure is pretty decent and WLB is good according to employees. They have a good automation team so I'll be part of an already established team. Established in SF and the co founders have experience in building startups.

I've worked at early stage startups before and it was kind of uncomfortable. One had a too casual CEO who would go under pressure on the smallest of my mistakes(even when I've filed a ticket for it). Another startup had a CEO who demanded a ""quality work"" and just refused to explain what he wanted so I had to figure things out myself.
Both of these experiences were good for me though the interaction with the CEOs were really bad.
Because of this reason I'm a bit hesitant to join company A.

With company B, they have received funding 6 months ago. I fear the usual pattern of hiring and firing will take place as they are on a hiring spree since the funding. 

With series A, they have asked for 5 days/week(sometimes 6) and their laptop will track my activity while working.They are spending and hiring a lot for research in the AI security space and they are developing their own models. All the AI engineers are from US, some from prestigious universities. But the work pressure will be more and the benefits by B will not be there except for medical insurance. Regardless of this they have raised series A half the funding of B within a year of founding.

A is providing esops, B is providing none.

A has only 5 Glassdoor reviews in which work pressure is repeated multiple times. B seems to have decent Glassdoor reviews.

A has very recent employees like 4-6 months. B has employees working since 2-3 years.

B matched A's offer after discussion. And then A increased the offer making my hike upto 110% if I join with them.

I'm confused on which one to go with.

"What are my options -- Architecture, EM (Engineering Manager), or simply a Technical Project Manager","15 YOE+. I am currently an Architect Manager at a large company w/ over 100k employees and probably 20K in IT/Engineering. I was hired as senior dev -> Architect ->Manager. An Architect Manager who's title is to manage other architects but in reality, I am managing a small team on SWAT projects. SWAT as in being inserted into adhoc new projects on-demand by CxO. There will be some pet project or something that needs to be delivered next week, I'll round out my devs and we will produce it. We are known as the SWAT team commandos.

I haven't coded in 5 years. But I do Architectural design and make day-to-day technical decisions, leading and managing my team. My promotions has been based on delivering big projects. Those projects then become full-fledge products that ends up becoming new departments; hiring 20-30 people. It will be 3 guys and myself who build a MVP. It was successfully demoed and then the company creates a department out of it.

Then I move on with my SWAT commandos to the next big thing. I am given greenfield - large scale projects where leadership gives me the discretion to hire/grow teams as needed.  In the beginning, I was managing all the members, projects, writing up stories,etc. As I had to juggle multiple projects, I have official project managers to help me and do the Agile rituals, standups, and write the stories while I do meetings and system design. The PMs may manage the agile ceremonies but I still dictate how, who should do the work and their priorities. This makes me feel like a PM but I don't get involved in the story creation, acceptance criterias and release management.

But as I wrote, I have not coded in 5 years but still do hands-on guidance. A dev would come to me on a solution and I'll dictate how it should be done. E.G. ""You can't just drop database tables in your import."" Or, ""You need to use an API gateway we have and add that to the CICD blueprint."" Or, ""we need to build DR (Disaster Recovery)/Failover and this is how we do it...""  
So I am actively hands on - code review, mentoring, and reviewing implementation.

Since I've been rather successful launching large scale projects with teams, I've been documenting them in my performance reviews and generally known as the Father or person who birth projects A,B,C,D... As my name is signed onto the white papers and software registries as the technical owner.  
When I get my bonuses signed off, they usually are commented that I was directly responsible for the product end-to-end. And in terms of value, CEO usually shout out our accomplishments during Town Halls like ""This quarter, a new product was introduced that saved 1000 manhours,  or increased productivity, or improve customer satisfaction by 30%""  
So documenting ""impact, contribution, and value"" isn't a problem.

I also have ""First mover's advantage"" in a lot of things. As I mentioned, our engineering teams are large and there are a lot siloes fighting for work. We'd be first to POC something then win the budget to implement. And we usually implement first before anyone. First to deploy K8s 8 years ago. First to ship a high volume, high transactional, scaleable highly distributed systems. First to meet to some regulatory compliance. First to ship a AI product used by millions in the entire organization.  
First this and that. Our scrappy team of 8 will get a major deliverable out against a dozen of other teams. We are also routinely asked to demo and give architectural overview of how we built our products and get them out so fast. So I do a lot of technical internal TED like talks to other architects/staff/principals.

The first mover's advantage is a bit harder to draft a narrative in a resume. Any pointers will be greatly appreciated. But the simple premise is. Give me a group of strong developers, some autonomy and I will be guy shipping multiple large projects and successfully deliver them over and over. Those projects will also be the most challenging in our industry domain,etc...

Now, I am thinking of leaving. Just for more pay. Possibly FAANG but I do not want to do leetcode. I know my accomplishments, high impact value, and scale of my work. I know I can lead a team in building a large scale, highly distributed, highly performant, and ultra-secure infrastructure dealing with large datalake of sensitive data. I am also known as creating jobs. Build a succesful product, it creates jobs , etc...

How do I pass the live coding?,"Hi, I have worked as a software developer for the last 3 years. I have coded in JS, React, Angular, Python, C#, and React Native. Every company loves my take-home challenges and says they are impressed. However, at every live coding, I have failed. I just cannot code when somebody is watching me. I am one of those who doesn't memorize anything and looks up when needed.

Do I need to compare two arrays in JS? Well, how did we used to do it in JS in a nice way? I look it up find it and use it. The next weeks, I forget that and look it up again. When I am not sure, I pull out a runtime and test if it works or not. Then implement it.

This doesn't fly with live coding where they are looking into how I code and if my basics are solid. I keep writing buggy code on the spot. Then the guy asks me ""Do you think this will work?"" then I panic. I am not sure, maybe? I will run it and see what doesn't and then fix it.

One company asks for the latest React feature, another asks to implement Currying in JS, another asks for a leet code algorithm, while another asks if I can write an API call, and then make it re-try 5 times if failed, another asks how do I compare two dates in JS.

"Just got laid off, unemployment now or after some studying? (CA)","Hi, I just got laid off yesterday (California). This was my first job and was working there for 4 years. I took a day to process it and now I'm ready to get to work. I was wondering if I should apply for unemployment now or wait until I'm actually ready to apply to jobs I care to work for. I have enough money saved to last me for a while, but don't want to leave unemployment money on the table.

  
I read that you need to actively apply to jobs to qualify for unemployment, so should I wait until I'm comfortable with leetcode? I'm almost halfway done with blind 75 and probably can finish within the next two weeks. I know that's not usually enough, but I can continue grinding while applying at that point.

Going Back To Do CS Degree,"**TL;DR:** I work in a cybersecurity risk management position, but I'm from a ""nontraditional"" background. In looking for other jobs, I've been getting feedback that I'm not ""technical enough"" after efforts to prove otherwise. Would going back to do a CS bachelor degree help the job search?

**Full:** 

I've been working a few years at a company mostly doing cybersecurity risk assessments. For a number of reasons, I'd like to change jobs. The short of my reasoning is my company is known in my area to be a sketchy mess. I love the substance of what I do, but the office politics are awful.

I've had trouble changing jobs for a bit now, even for similar positions. I'm not the strongest interviewer: I have to work on it. But most of the dings come before the live interview stage.

Without outing myself, my background is legal/compliance with a few coding bootcamps (think different classes, really). I did well in the bootcamps, but I obviously know how folks feel about them. 

Otherwise, I'm pretty driven. I've gotten a couple of the more ""impressive"" certs (to the extent that means anything) earlier than most people do. I also do a lot of self-study on the side when I'm not tied up.

I recently applied to a risk management position at a compnay that is...uh, ""Reddit infamous"" for its recruitment process. (I'll spare the name.) I got through a written interview and their quasi-IQ test, and then got dinged. 

The thing is, because their process is so weird and personal, I requested my data back from them. My assumption was that I did badly on the quasi-IQ test, hence why I got rejected a couple days after submitting it.

Not so, though. I got the data back and scored in the 99th percentile for the test. I don't think it ultimately means anything, but I was surprised. Along with the data package came some comments from an old guy basically complaining that I wasn't ""technical"" enough. The comments were pretty rough, but in the interest of not taking stuff personally and trying to extract the gems from the rock, I've been considering if my background is my fundamental problem.

So, I'm thinking about doing a CS degree (in addition to the education I already have) during my nights and weekends. There's a path where I am that's not extremely expensive, though it may take me a little bit. The side benefit is that I'd like to learn more about OSes anyway, and this is a structured way to do it.

My friends think the additional degree won't help and emphasize networking more. I do network some, but again, I'm not a particularly strong people person. The other thing I can think of is more up-to-date relevant projects. I have limited time, and it helps when I have a structure. But I could probably figure out something on my own in that regard.

Should I change my name? Or is it just that rough out there?,"Hello fellow searchers!

Let's start with the self awareness: 

1) Degree from an online school.

2) Experience from smaller companies/startups. 

3) My resume/portfolio might be seriously lacking, so feel free to roast that as well. 

  
I'm aware that those things don't make me a super shining star. But with almost 10YOE, I thought i'd be getting at least some interviews. I'm a decent, but not great technical interviewer, but the crux of the issue right now is that I'm not even getting to screening calls. Out of \~100 apps in the last month, I've gotten one screening call from Ramp, which felt like it went great and then they decided to not move forward with the technicals, no reason given.  Besides that, I've gotten like 5 denials and just haven't heard back from anyone else. 

I also know it's not a great time of year to be looking, but my last company is shutting down, so I'm on the hunt. Additionally, I'm aware that coming from startups and breaking into bigger enterprise orgs blindly is gonna be a challenge.

I'm currently grinding LeetCode and Frontend Lead to improve my interview skills, but even that feels useless when I'm not getting to screening.

Queue my conspiracy theory: My family immigrated to the states in '97. I learned English with the rest of the American kids.

How I landed a job as a college dropout,"Hi everyone, I'm Asiqur, a 23-year-old software engineer currently working at [Codédex](https://www.codedex.io/home).

As the title mentions, I'm a college drop out who managed to somehow land a job. Not during covid but in 2023 when the job market was almost as bad as it is now.

TLDR: **Prioritize connections over anything else and just ask for things.**

I dropped out of college after a semester. I wont get into the reasons why but it's something I have 0 regrets of doing. After dropping out, I went the route of self learning, I didn't attend any bootcamp or programs during this time. Instead I learned everything off of Youtube and creating projects. Not your todo list projects but projects I wanted to actually use myself and turn into a business. You can look through my post history to see the ones I'm talking about. This was during the beginning of 2020.

I did this for almost 2-3 years, creating different projects and seeing how much I can grow them. Most of them were fails but some of them had moderate success. During this I wasn't really looking for a job...to this day I still dont have a proper resume. Then one day, I received a message from Sonny (founder of Codédex) through Linkedin to check out a project he was working on. I took a look at it, found it interesting and joined the Discord they had. I was lurking in their for a month or two, only interacting for somethings. After two months, I decided to send him a message through discord DM's. That message was a pitch to let me work on Codédex, the pitch basically went like ""Yo you dont have to pay me but lemme just help build this thing and see how a startup is ran. Then if things work out we can see about actually being onboarded"". My thinking from my personal side was, ""I've been doing this for two years, and none of my projects have really blown up. So lemme see how a actual startup is ran and what I can get from it"". But long story short, the answer was yes, I then moved on to full time (Jan 2023) and it's been two years since then. I'm now considered a founding team member. So a lot has happened.

But the question is why was it a yes to a frankly dumb pitch. This all happened because prior to this I actually knew Sonny. Not well but through a early career internship. In high school I was in a program that gets students internship during senior year of high school. During this I was put in the company he was working at the time as a high school intern. After the internship, I added as many people as I could from that internship on Linkedin. This was in 2019. Through that connection, almost 3 years later, I received that initial message from him because of that connection.

Is it dumb to take a break after getting laid off?,"I'm wondering if it is a bad idea to not immediately pursue employment after a lay off.

For context:
I have 3.5 years of experience as a web developer.

I dropped out of college senior year @ 21 years old because I was offered full time work as a developer. I had an amazing experience working there and learned a ton but unfortunately I was laid off last week.

I'm now in a position where I have 5 months before the classes I need to graduate at my previous university will be offered.

I was planning on enjoying this 5 month vacation before returning to school and finishing my degree in CS. 

After this gap and the time it takes to finish my degree, in total I estimate it will be about 10 months before I'm ready to start looking for work again.

I graduated back in May 2024, didn't really start job searching until July/August, and have been on the hunt since then.

"Am I a wimp, or does tech suck?","I spent the past decade working my ass transitioning into tech (was in economics before), learning to program, took a bunch of classes on AI/ML, and had 2 stints as SDE/MLE at the MAANG's in the last 5 years.

I thought OOP was the coolest thing, abstractions, modeling things, making tools and seeing other people's amazement when using them.

Switch from SRE to SWE,"I’m currently working as an SRE and my current position is pretty laidback and chill.

Been interviewing for SWE type roles because I thought that’s the route that I wanted to take because I want to build and not ask other teams to build and I thought I could learn more. I also feel like the lateral from SWE to SRE in the future if I wanted to go back would be easier than SRE to SWE. I was fortunate enough to get an offer from a smaller company. The compensation is about the same though. Not sure on if I take the job, keep interviewing and hope for an offer with more money or stay as SRE?

Family Moving from Austin to Seattle,"We’re considering whether moving from Austin, TX, to Seattle, WA, would be worth it for our family. Here’s the context: 

We are both software engineers living in Austin TX. We have a three month old infant. We own a property near Austin. We have been in this area for a few years now, and it’s been nice!

However, we are considering the possibility of moving because Seattle offers a more mature tech market, higher compensation potential, proximity to top tech companies, and more opportunities to grow in our careers. We do not see the same potential here in Austin.

Our priorities also include living in a safe, family-friendly area, access to strong STEM education and career opportunities for our child, and options for bilingual education. 

Is it worth moving to Seattle for better tech opportunities and compensation, even if it means higher expenses and giving up the stability we currently enjoy in Austin? We’d love to hear from others who have faced a similar decision or have experience with life in either city.

Hate my 1:1’s. Blamed for PM’s feature.,"New grad in big tech, 4 months of exp. 2 months back, our PM asked me to implement a very tiny feature. I delivered. 2 other devs more experienced than me gave me their blessing.

1 month later, it’s aggravating other teams because this PM’s feature was a wide brushstroke change that affected them. It turns out that the PM was trying to solve one small issue and asked me to add this wide brushstroke change, with my Eng Mgr’s blessing. My PM never told me the exact small issue at hand he was really trying to target, he made it seem like he just needed this change because it was a literal customer ask. This is all I knew.

So, I am asked to revert the change by EM, PM, and this team.

In my 1:1’s with my EM that I’ve grown to hate, I’m asked why I wasted my time doing this feature that was inevitably reversed. #1, this EM is the one who told me to implement the feature the PM wanted.

I tell him I gave the PM the item he asked for alongside the blessing of other devs and I was never informed on what specific issue he’s trying to target (which changes the instruction entirely). 

He said I should “think outside the box” more and be “more resourceful” to “catch” this, but to me, this requires a futuristic hindsight instinct that I wouldn’t just “know” to do. No instruction pointed me that way, I’m 2 months in and just cloned that repo. The other devs worked closely with me on it and had the same assumptions as me.

When I told my EM I did what I was asked with others’ approvals, I’m told I shouldn’t blame others for my wasted time. What? I’m explaining how we got here. He also said it’s not enough to do what’s asked, but I don’t have the hindsight intuition that he seems to desire because of my unfamiliarity with the codebases. I get these “intuitions” ime after working on a system maybe the 2nd or 3rd time.

In fact, I learn literally nothing in our 1:1’s. I’m fine with criticism, but I never feel I can “implement” any of his suggestions in practice. Everything he suggests I should’ve done is “hindsight is 2020” that I seem to be expected of but none of the other devs who onboard me are. I literally cannot promise him “I’ll be better” next time because every suggestion seems to require fortune telling privileged knowledge. I’m not a time traveler.

Is this normal?

College student - what am I doing wrong? How important art certs vs degree?,"I am roughly halfway through a degree in Cybersecurity and would say I understand more than the average Joe, and  more than the bare bones entry-level IT professional in most areas and on par with the basic stuff in other areas (discrete mathematics for example). I have a professionally made resume and have created several python scripts which I’ve shared on github, as well as some random html/css stuff, in the hopes that it shows I have drive for self teaching.

Still, I have had incredible difficulty finding any jobs that will even give me a call back.

The 1st one that responded offered $13/hr which I just literally can’t afford to live off of. I can’t even pay my rent with that. The 2nd, I supposedly passed the 1st interview and then they never followed up for a 2nd interview, while also expecting me to work 6 days a week and on call for the 7th. I was willing to do it because it’s a higher wage than what I make now and hands on IT experience, but they seemed to fall off after the holidays and never reached out again.

All of that being said, I haven’t gotten my certs yet.  due to both money and time constraints.


How important are certs for landing a job nowadays? I was under the impression that general knowledge could get you an entry level position, let alone formal education in the field. I do know that I will have to get higher level certs as time goes on (CISSP, for example). My main hindrance is money atm, since I am a (cliche) broke college student and just can’t afford to fork out $400 for even an emergency, much less an IT test.

That being said, I’m really only trying to get my feet wet in the industry and get hands on experience in a corporate environment rather than a home environment. I don’t mind working a lower (livable) wage to get the hands on experience I need. My degree eventually requires an internship to complete it, and this all concerns me whether I’ll be able to get one, since I can’t get a call back for a job even!

What’s the current climate for these kinds of jobs? Is the issue that I don’t have an entry level cert like A+, Net+, Sec+, etc? Or is it something else? Should I get an internship under my belt? Focus on highlighting other things on my github than scripts? I’ve been considering reaching out to my local computer fixer lllc and seeing if he’ll let me intern for him, just to have something under my belt. Would you consider that helpful or pointless?

Any advice is deeply appreciated.

Need Education Advice,"Hi! I graduated from a very good institution with my Bachelor's in Business. For the last several years I have been working as a software engineer, and although I know my stack well, I feel like I am missing out on fundamental tech knowledge. On top of that, it is getting harder to promote without a degree in Computer Science. 

So I've decided I want to go back to school. But I have one serious problem, I graduated with a 2.1 GPA. The school was fantastic but due to undiagnosed mental health issues (now resolved) I crashed hard the last two years of my degree. Due to my low GPA, I've been rejected from several MS in CS programs already, such as Georgia Tech's OMSCS.

So I thought of a few options: 

1. I could do Harvard's ALM in Computer Science. I like the fact you can earn your way in (they ignore undergraduate GPA), but I don't like the ""extension studies"" degree name. According to the website, the degree is a Master of Liberal Arts in Extension Studies, with a field of computer science. At the end of the day, it is a Master's degree in the field of computer science.

3. Another option is WGU. I can get a second Bachelor's degree from WGU. So I would have one in Business from a good college combined with a Bachelor's in CS from WGU. If I get good grades I may be a better candidate for graduate coursework in the future. This seems very optimal as the degree is flexible but I'm worried how it would look on a resume.

3. My final option is to do a Master's in IT at Liberty. I'm worried about how employers look at the school so that's low on the list. 

Regardless, I want to go back to school, could anyone more senior provide some advice for me on what they would do. Obviously I'm open to better ideas. Note I do have GI Bill so cost is irrelevant to me.",need education advice,hi graduated good institution bachelors business last several years working software engineer although know stack well feel like missing fundamental tech knowledge top getting harder promote without degree computer science ive decided want go back school one serious problem graduated gpa school fantastic due undiagnosed mental health issues resolved crashed hard last two years degree due low gpa ive rejected several ms cs programs already georgia techs omscs thought options could harvards alm computer science like fact earn way ignore undergraduate gpa dont like extension studies degree name according website degree master liberal arts extension studies field computer science end day masters degree field computer science another option wgu get second bachelors degree wgu would one business good college combined bachelors cs wgu get good grades may better candidate graduate coursework future seems optimal degree flexible im worried would look resume final option masters liberty im worried employers look school thats low list regardless want go back school could anyone senior provide advice would obviously im open better ideas note gi bill cost irrelevant,0.0,0.9648,positive,"['good', 'well', 'like', 'top', 'promote', 'want', 'fantastic', 'resolved', 'like', 'like', 'good', 'good', 'better', 'optimal', 'flexible', 'liberty', 'want', 'better']","['missing', 'serious', 'problem', 'hard', 'low', 'rejected', 'ignore', 'worried', 'worried', 'low']"
How to turn work off when not at the office? ,"I’m finding it hard to truly disconnect from work after I leave the office.

I just came back from a week vacation and I disconnected pretty well but the last day of the vacation before starting work I started to think about all the things at work I needed to do, even dreaming about something work related.

I am worried that a startup I am apart of might because of our CTO's set of incredibly strict software design philosophies. They're new to iOS but incredibly talented. How can I tell if I should learn or leave?,"I have recently began work at a small startup. I am on an iOS team that used to be me and a principal engineer. But it now is just me. The principal engineer left shortly after the V1 of the app and I am guessing it mostly had to do with personal issues plus the fact that he is possibly the richest person I have ever been in contact with.

It's my first startup and i'm really struggling. Im less than a few months in. 3 YoE total experience.

The startup is doing great. I like the mission. We are killing it.

Our CTO is a workaholic. He's pushing code around 10-14 hours each day and it isn't unusual to see at least 6 hours of work over the weekend. That being said he is exceptional at his job. He's an Ace.

The problem I am having is I am told to ship features quickly, but time and time again my code is stuck in a lengthy review process. Unfortunately, now that our principal iOS engineer left, the only person who can review my code now is the CTO. While he's incredibly talented and capable he's new to iOS and this is his first iOS app. He learned relatively quickly and writes it well. But he has a tendency to try make everything look like its react code even though this is SwiftUI. He is therefore un-compromising about a set of rules.

Sometimes his feedback is spot on but sometimes it seems like we're not philosophically aligned and that he is unwilling to accept code that is roughly equivalent or at the very least just as simple or risky or maintainable as what he wants.

Ive asked others at the company how he is in reviews with them and it sounds like he's just as strict and that they kind of just rely on him to tell them exactly how he will want them to do anything that might involve a new class/ui component/etc.

Some of his ideas are flat out awful though. Things that I have explained I have never seen another iOS engineer do and he can't explain to me why his version is any bit better than the more traditional one. Chiefly he puts little emphasis on aspects of maintainability. Lines of code are long, files are huge, classes are nested, functions are bloated, things aren't factored out into smaller pieces.

Maybe with a bit of time I will crack the code of his philosophies and be able to ship features without it feeling like a struggle every time. But still, there are some things he asks me to do that I know deep down aren't normal and you would never see in a different iOS codebase but am not in a position to argue about with him.

Ive been familiar in 4 different iOS codebases now so I at least have a sense of what's normal and what works.

When it comes to PR review I just deeply wish he could find some definition that is close enough to perfection so we can keep development moving. Perhaps eventually I will crack his style and be able to put up PR after PR that does not get bogged in review. But I have no idea... maybe I am the issue here and maybe I have a lot more to learn than I think and am failing to put up high quality PRs.

With this in mind I have a few specific questions. Because I am on the fence about whether to use this experience to grow or whether to jump ship and pretend like this job never happened.

1. Given I no longer have a senior iOS mentor here and am just being ""mentored"" by the CTO with web experience and some iOS experience is it a good idea to stick around? Could I still become a better engineer if I work hard here.
2. Is a CTO who is this stringent about specific code philosophies going to be able to scale the company to where it needs to be? Most of what was built and is a successful product was built by him on web/backend and the former principal iOS engineer working without reviewing each other's code. The future of our company will have to involve more people.

I would be so sad to leave this company. But at some point I need to look out for me. I am not sure I can make it a year here without being frustrated incredibly often. I am also not sure they wont fire me for not delivering features quick enough because I am not getting his strict and seemingly arbitrary set of rules.

My manager seems to be in a weird spot here. They are an excellent coach and web engineer but they have no experience with iOS and thus can't tell the difference between a grave stylistic oversight in a PR and just moving things around till it's perfect.",worried startup apart might ctos set incredibly strict software design philosophies theyre new ios incredibly talented tell learn leave,recently began work small startup ios team used principal engineer principal engineer left shortly v app guessing mostly personal issues plus fact possibly richest person ever contact first startup im really struggling im less months yoe total experience startup great like mission killing cto workaholic hes pushing code around hours day isnt unusual see least hours work weekend said exceptional job hes ace problem told ship features quickly time time code stuck lengthy review process unfortunately principal ios engineer left person review code cto hes incredibly talented capable hes new ios first ios app learned relatively quickly writes well tendency try make everything look like react code even though swiftui therefore uncompromising set rules sometimes feedback spot sometimes seems like philosophically aligned unwilling accept code roughly equivalent least simple risky maintainable wants ive asked others company reviews sounds like hes strict kind rely tell exactly want anything might involve new classui componentetc ideas flat awful though things explained never seen another ios engineer cant explain version bit better traditional one chiefly puts little emphasis aspects maintainability lines code long files huge classes nested functions bloated things arent factored smaller pieces maybe bit time crack code philosophies able ship features without feeling like struggle every time still things asks know deep arent normal would never see different ios codebase position argue ive familiar different ios codebases least sense whats normal works comes pr review deeply wish could find definition close enough perfection keep development moving perhaps eventually crack style able put pr pr get bogged review idea maybe issue maybe lot learn think failing put high quality prs mind specific questions fence whether use experience grow whether jump ship pretend like job never happened given longer senior ios mentor mentored cto web experience ios experience good idea stick around could still become better engineer work hard cto stringent specific code philosophies going able scale company needs built successful product built webbackend former principal ios engineer working without reviewing others code future company involve people would sad leave company point need look sure make year without frustrated incredibly often also sure wont fire delivering features quick enough getting strict seemingly arbitrary set rules manager seems weird spot excellent coach web engineer experience ios thus cant tell difference grave stylistic oversight pr moving things around till perfect,0.2944,0.9926,positive,"['richest', 'great', 'like', 'talented', 'capable', 'well', 'like', 'like', 'accept', 'like', 'kind', 'want', 'better', 'huge', 'feeling', 'like', 'wish', 'perfection', 'like', 'good', 'better', 'successful', 'sure', 'sure', 'excellent', 'perfect']","['struggling', 'killing', 'problem', 'stuck', 'unfortunately', 'risky', 'awful', 'struggle', 'argue', 'failing', 'pretend', 'hard', 'sad', 'leave', 'frustrated', 'fire', 'weird', 'grave']"

How much is too much when negotiating a raise,"3YOE at same small company (2 of those years as a part time intern). I feel like the work I do is way above my pay grade as a junior developer.

*own features that hold down some of our big name contracts
*work independently, PRs only ever need minor changes if any
*understand the codebase enough to help others troubleshoot

I know of a previous junior for the same team that got 33% more than I started with, same profile.  Rubs me the wrong way and I want to leave but but admittedly I really really love the stuff I get to work on. If they gave me that much I would consider staying longer.

Considering getting a masters degree in bioinformatics or Geospatial information systems. Need help with the feasibility of this and if it is worth while doing,"
Hi. I hope this reaches enough people. I’m a 2022 Comp Sci undergrad, currently a Programmer Analyst with 1+ YOE. 

I currently like my job, and what I do. I wouldn’t mind doing it for a while, but I simply don’t get paid enough. Only $56k. I talked to my manager about a raise or promotion and he said it wouldn’t be possible since it’s a government contracting job and the company I work for can only offer me as much as the government is willing to pay, essentially. 

So I’ve been looking for a new job. In looking for a new job, I was wondering if I should go to grad school and get a M.S. Two degree programs that intrigued me were GIS and Bioinformatics. 

GIS actually kinda ties into what I do right now a little bit as a “Satellite software specialist”. But jobs related to this field seemingly don’t pay all that much. 

Bioinformatics sounds truly interesting, but I’m concerned my lack of educational experience in biology would make this difficult to pursue. 

I’m hoping I can get advice on this, if pursuing an M.S. is truly worth it and if so, how feasible would either of these degrees be with my limited background and in terms of financial returns

When must we say “no”?,"I’ve been thinking about workplace ethics and I’d love to hear your perspectives. 

We all know that executives have a fiduciary duty to maximize shareholder value, which introduces moral hazard, which can lead to questionable decisions. 

But how far is too far? And what kind of requests should we consider unreasonable to make? Are there orders we should flat-out refuse to follow, or even attempt to sabotage?

Here are some examples (both real and hypothetical) that I’ve seen or heard about:

* Laying People Off During Record Profits  

The company is posting its best numbers in years, yet leadership moves forward with large-scale layoffs to further boost margins. As a manager, you’re asked to identify your lowest performers so they can be let go. Should you do it?

* Dark Patterns in Games/Social Media  

Designing features that nudge or trick users into spending more time, revealing private info, becoming unhealthily addicted to the platform, or wasting money. How do you decide what features are ethically okay to work on?

* Deadly Products  

I can imagine working for a company like Toyota, Volkswagen, Boeing or Tesla, and being asked to design systems more quickly than can be done safely, or forego a best-practices quality process. Let’s image you work for Tesla, they’re trying to meet a quarterly deadline and they tell you to skip writing unit tests for the system that determines whether or not it’s safe for the car to accelerate. Do you do it?

* Replacing Local Staff with Offshore Teams  

Sometimes it makes business sense to hire cheaper labor overseas. But what if your company asks you, a manager, to lie to your subordinates so they’re more willing to train their own replacements, who will eventually take their jobs? At what point does cooperating with the process cross ethical lines?

* Misleading the Workforce  

Maybe leadership is pressuring you to misrepresent the stability or future of a project, or to conceal potential hazards (like budget cuts) so that employees stay motivated or keep quiet.

Continue with OMSCS or apply for Engineering Management KSU (online)?,"Currently enrolled in Georgia Tech's OMSCS program and debating whether it's worth continuing with it. It's a lot of workload and I'm not really feeling like I'm getting much out of it since I already did my BS in CS at Georgia Tech. Also not really too hopeful for the future of SWE given all the AI stuff and layoffs happening in the industry.

I'm thinking of applying to KSU's Masters in engineering management program because it seems like a good balance and I want to eventually get into management roles. I currently hold a fulltime job in SWE and my employer is paying the tuition for my Masters which is the main reason why I started OMSCS. Also many job apps give faster promotion or lesser requirements to those who have Masters (ex. 2 years work experience w/ Masters vs 4 years work experience w/o) so if I'm able to complete my Masters while working fulltime that would be great. My colleagues are also doing online 1-year programs in MBA or management degrees after finishing a technical degree in their undergrad.

But I'm not sure if it's worth switching over. I just started OMSCS last semester and I only took 1 class (withdrew from the other one) so if I want to change I should do it sooner rather than later.

" CS undergrad, 2 YoE Frontend developer, want to ask questions about CS fundamentals ","To preface following post, I am 26 years old, a CS undergrad, graduated 2 years ago, and have since been working as a frontend developer. I am new to this subreddit, so forgive me, if question like this was already asked. Also, if mods remove this, please tell me how can I change the post up so it gets accepted?  
  
I have been immensely enjoying my work, working with others, learning off other brilliant developers, and so on. While career in CS so far has afforded me a greater and positive work-life balance, compared to other fields, and I have spent my free time actively doing other stuff than just coding, I have also regularly refreshing my CS fundamentals, of which I have an even better grasp than when I did those courses in my uni (multithreading fucky still).  
  
My question is to all experienced developers here, and I know this is a tricky and long winded question. My personal view in all this AI era is that while AI can lead to issues, developers with particularly stronger grasp over CS fundamentals, and frontend fundamentals in my case as well, will be able to progress further, and be constantly and smoothly update themselves to newer tech stacks etc. Personal anecdote here would be that I spent considerable amount of time getting a strong grasp of CSS, flexbox, Grid, which has helped me a lot in adapting better and better to whatever stack I am asked to use. My question is how do you experience folks keep yourselves updated, any blogs, websites, channels etc and any resources you have to strengthen your CS fundamentals? As mentioned earlier, I have been doing all of that, but having more knowledge and resources can never hurt.   
  
And, second question, is for the web developers here. Obviously, internet is a fast and changing field, how do you with many many years of experience, have kept yourselves relevant and updated, since every other year, seems to be some new ? Any tips, and advice you have vis-à-vis frontend? Also, lately I have been wanting to get into backend as well, any resources and guides regarding that? I just don't want to do coast and do my job, I want to actually understand and keep getting better at it.

Should I Stay in My Current Job or Take a Risk with a New Opportunity? ,"I’m facing a tough career decision and could use your input. I’ve recently been offered a new job as a developer, but it comes with some risks. Here’s the situation:

Current Job:

I’m working in IT support, and while it’s stable, I feel like it’s not helping me grow in the areas I’m passionate about.

I have a solid 5 months left on my contract, with a good chance of renewal for another year.


New Job:

It’s in a field I’m excited about (Odoo development), which aligns with my long-term goals.

There’s a strict 3-month probation period, with the first month being critical. If I don’t meet their expectations in that first month, they might end the contract early.

The role offers much better growth opportunities in terms of skills and career development.



About Me:
I have a master’s degree in AI and Data Science, and while I enjoy tech, I want to transition into more development-focused work. I’ve started gaining experience with Odoo by creating a few custom modules, but I’m still learning.

The Dilemma:
Should I stay in my stable job or take the risk with the new opportunity?

The current job is safe and predictable, but it doesn’t align with my aspirations.

The new job offers growth and aligns with my goals, but there’s a significant risk with the probation period.


What I’m Asking:

Have you ever faced a decision like this?
Any advice for succeeding in a high-pressure first month on a new job?


Thanks in advance for any insights!

How I learned to stop worrying about containers and love the cloud,"Names changed to protect the dead and innocent.

The bright afternoon sun shines into my open office. Its 2:05PM I notice as I stare blankly at my Laptop.

""It's gone,"" says Fred, one of the senior DevOps engineers.

""What's gone?"" I ask.

""ALL OF IT,"" Fred replies.

I fire up Chrome and type `https://player.bigcorp.tv`. Nothing. A white background in small Monaco font reads: ""Server Error"". I press F12 and check developer tools. The status code column reads a singular 502. Our front-end is served from one service and the backend API, for which I am responsible, is served from another service. Using a terminal I check the backend with a curl command to see if I can hit publicly accessible data. Another 502. I quickly navigate to `https://internal.bigcorp.tv/status`, and see ""Server Error"" again. I type `https://internal.bigcorp.tv/status` into the location bar. Our internal status is also throwing the now familiar ""Server Error."" ""Where is Logan?"" I ask. ""He left for lunch,"" replies Fred.

We login to the root AWS account and start checking our super resilient, uncrashable Mesos infrastructure that was costing up to $100,000 a month. Mesos has worker nodes that require connection to the control plane nodes to operate. Fred explains that the control plane nodes, running on virtual machines, in AWS had been corrupted and rebuilt that morning. The reason our infrastructure was uncrashable was our lead DevOps engineer, Ryan, had extra control plane nodes running in Mesos itself. This self-hosted model allowed us to always spin up Mesos masters in such an event. The DevOps Manager, Logan, was away at lunch.

The control plane running in Mesos had split brained and was unable to take over the leader role when the AWS nodes were rebuilt. Fred had thought restarting them would quickly synchronize all the control plane nodes, and if anything was wrong we had backups of the control plane data. When this happened, unbeknownst to Fred, they lost the only good copy of the master data. Docker containers, if not mounted to a machine on their host, have ephemeral disk space. ""The last backup was 4 months ago,"" Fred informs me. ""Does Will know?"" I ask. Will is my boss and the Director of our Digital TV Product.

""IF THIS IS NOT UP IMMEDIATELY THEY ARE GOING TO FIRE ME AND ALL OF YOU,"" yells Will. As usual the concern of Will not earning income while his high profile attorney wife cucks him is first of his concerns. ""WHERE THE FUCK ARE LOGAN AND BRADEN?"" Braden is the mastermind of this Mesos Architecture, likely he could fix it, however, Braden is spending his vacation by visiting Burning Man for the first time. His boss Logan is MIA at lunch. Will gives Logan a call and informs him the entire platform is down for customers and every internal media management employee at the company.

2:45 PM.

Logan enters the office and scowls at me. Surprisingly, he walks straight to where the action is. I half-expected him to retreat to the DevOps room and tinker with his modular synthesizer letting everyone else clean up the mess. I've had multiple public fights with him about the cost of running this Mesos Frankenstein. My budget partially pays for the $100,000 a month infrastructure. ""The point of a container orchestration platform is to scale down so we can spend LESS money,"" I would scream after noting the bill had gone up more than 10x a month after migrating to his Mesos infrastructure. Now, despite how awesome the Mesos platform is, and how all my teams would love it, it is down.

By 4:00 PM afternoon bar patrons, I mean alcoholics, have been without bar TV almost 3 hours. The only thing Logan has accomplished is pacing nervously around the office and occasionally breathing stale, hungover breath into Fred's ear. The head of North America is now hovering, with Will my boss. Unfortunately the mobile and TV apps were crashing every time you tap or click the TV icon. Our platform provides digital TV to a European TV product. Europe is asleep by now, but the customers, and our European execs, will definitely start calling by morning. If you have never been yelled at by a German exec, its just as terrifying as old WW2 clips have you believe. Everyone looks increasingly nervous. ""We can just run the services on bare AWS without Mesos,"" I suggest.

Logan had finally made contact with Braden via text. He stated the Mesostein was in jeopardy and if they didn't fix it, he would certainly lose his job. Even though Braden had not slept the night before and may or may not have had pharmaceutical assistance with not sleeping he decided to hurriedly leave Burning Man and drive the 8 hours back to the office, targeting arrival before 11PM.

The backend is a simple Golang app which is easy to run with a single command. I demo to Will and the NA lead how I can route the DNS directly to the box via auto scaling groups, which gets us scaling out of the box. The database for the backend was not impacted and running in RDS, so this works, and we see TV show titles and M3U8 playlist URLs in a JSON blob. At 4:15 PM we have a strategy.

It didn't take long to get the front-end application running again, which was a simple node.js app. Hitting the staging URL the site was back-up, but not the internal management tools of it. At 5:15PM we shout ""HOORAY!"" The site is back up. Unfortunately, the service which serves the M3U8 playlists responsible for playing the video is a Java web-service, whose lead has just left the company. In parallel the video playout team had been trying to get the service running, but they are not familiar with the dark arts of Linux CLI and the AWS console. Fred and the DevOps team is still trying to jolt Frankenmesos back to life so they are of little help.

A new engineer on the video team frustrated with the verbosity and complexity of the service had built a skunk works project which generated M3U8 playlists for video. It was missing the advertising stitching capability, but it would play video if you pointed our video player at it without ads. We demoed this to Will. ""We can just change the M3U8 url in the database for the non-working video service to this service,"" we say. ""But its completely untested,"" Will says. ""Yeah but no video works, what do we have to lose?"", I reply. ""Fuck it,"" he says.

The next 4 hours we spent spinning up new services by hand on AWS running the video service with nohup after SSHing into them on public IP addresses. Around 7PM I receive a phone call from Braden. He tells me to check my text messages. I look and see a message he's sent with a picture. The picture contains a small BMW hatchback connected to a small UHaul. Both are totally destroyed, the contents of the UHaul are strewn about the highway complete with a bunny onesie and California mountains in the background.

Midnight.

We were now watching video on our player, streaming from a completely untested service. The database was updated with the new service URL just as our European customers started waking up to watch. The video team was now free to go home, and the DevOps team was directed to help them get the old video service running in the morning.

At 7 AM I arrive back in the office with a $5 pour over coffee in hand. The video team beat me there. They were still trying to save face and get their application working after being bested by a junior engineer and weekend project. Despite the panic of the previous day, they were close to getting back up and running.

I take the team and Fred out to a food truck lunch for take out. We pass Logan as we approach the second office building. ""I'm out,"" he says. ""Leaving already after yesterday?"" I ask, but shit like this isn't surprising for him. ""They fired me,"" he replies. ""I guess we will always have Mesos,"" I say. ""Hey, come over into my office,"" Will catches me offguard holding my Butter chicken, which is burning my hand, but soon to burn my asshole. ""How would you like to run the DevOps team as well?"" he says. ""Only if we can delete that hell spawn of an infrastructure,"" I reply.

"How good are ""safety"" schools?","Hi all, I applied to a few universities a couple months ago. In the UK, I applied to Lancaster, Durham, Warwick, King's, Edinburgh. And I applied to TU Delft and TU Eindhoven in the Netherlands. 

Right now I got accepted conditionally into Durham and Lancaster and I got rejected from King's. 

Hypothetically if I don't meet the conditions for my top unis, is Lancaster a good enough school to give me good job opportunities? If an employer sees on my resume ""Lancaster CS bachelor"" will that make my chances lower than if I had TU Delft or Edinburgh for example? 

Right now the uni that interests me the most is Delft, but, although this might seem a bit childish, I noticed that there's barely any vacation there. Only 2 weeks for Christmas and 1 week during spring (there's also 2 months in summer but thats pretty standard). 

From what I've heard, Delft is an extremely hard uni to study at due the high chances of failing the first year. Is going there worth the effort? Does graduating from TU Delft give good job opportunities?

Also, could someone rank the unis I listed in terms of reputation and then in terms of quality? Would be much appreciated.

Average base salary: what SHOULD it be for software engineers in the US? ,"There's been a lot of concern recently about tech companies trying to suppress wages but I'm wondering if we are on same page about how much a software engineer SHOULD make. 

As I see it, if we don't assert and defend the value of our labor, we are ultimately forcing the companies to decide: and companies always wants the product ""good enough"" at the cheapest possible price. 

So, how much should a software engineer be paid on average?

Considering getting a masters degree in bioinformatics or Geospatial information systems. Need help with the feasibility of this and if it is worth while doing,"Hi. I hope this reaches enough people. I’m a 2022 Comp Sci undergrad, currently a Programmer Analyst with 1+ YOE. 

I currently like my job, and what I do. I wouldn’t mind doing it for a while, but I simply don’t get paid enough. Only $56k.

So I’ve been looking for a new job. In looking for a new job, I was wondering if I should go to grad school and get a M.S. Two degree programs that intrigued me were GIS and Bioinformatics. 

GIS actually kinda ties into what I do right now a little bit as a “Satellite software specialist”. But jobs related to this field seemingly don’t pay all that much. 

Bioinformatics sounds truly interesting, but I’m concerned my lack of educational experience in biology would make this difficult to pursue. 

I’m hoping I can get advice on this, if pursuing an M.S. is truly worth it and if so, how feasible would either of these degrees be with my limited background and in terms of financial returns

"Stuck in low paying job, need advice in moving forward.","Hi everyone,

I’m currently working as a software developer for a company that has been operating for over 15 years. It’s not a complete software company but rather an industrial automation company, and I’m their first software developer. I’ve been tasked with developing a web application from scratch to manage their processes. While the job has provided some learning opportunities, the salary is just ₹15,000(175 usd per month) , and there’s no PF or other benefits.

What’s frustrating is that the management has made it almost clear that there won’t be any substantial hike. For context, someone in the company with 2 years of experience earns only ₹20,000(233 usd per month) .

Here’s a bit more about my situation:

My tech stack includes Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL. I’m essentially a full-stack developer working on all aspects of the web application, including backend development, frontend design, and database management.

One of the biggest challenges is the constant changes to requirements. Every time I complete a feature or task, they come back with changes or ask for something different, which makes it hard to feel productive or accomplished.

Recently, they’ve also started asking me to work on Saturdays, which has added to my frustration.

When I brought up a salary increase with HR, I was told it had to be discussed with the management, but there’s been no follow-up or clarity on future growth prospects.


I’ve decided to start looking for new opportunities, but I’m unsure about the best approach:

Should I quit now and focus entirely on job hunting, or is it better to secure a new job first before quitting?

How can I position myself better for higher-paying roles, given my 9 months of experience as a full-stack developer?

Are there any specific skills, certifications, or projects I should focus on to enhance my profile?

How do I explain my low current salary in interviews without it affecting their perception of my value?

I built a tool ranking the world's best cities (financially) for a SWE to live in,"Hey everyone! After seeing countless ""Should I take this job in X or Y?"" posts, I wanted to share something I built that might help with these decisions.

As a data-obsessed SWE in Berlin looking to maximize my own career choices, I created a tool that shows you what you ACTUALLY keep after taxes and expenses in different tech hubs. Not just the fancy salaries on levels.fyi, but real purchasing power.

Some eye-opening findings that might help with your next career move:

1. Seattle and Austin beat SF for take-home pay because:
 * You get similar FAANG/tech salaries
 * No state income tax
 * Way cheaper housing than SF
 * Same access to top tech companies

2. The US is still the undisputed #1 place for SWEs:
* A remote SWE in the middle of nowhere in the US (no disrespect, Kansas City) earns 42% more money than a London-based engineer due to:
 * 32% lower living costs
 * Much lower taxes

3. Western Europe is not even second best (for those considering international moves):
 * Milan engineers earn 54% less than Abu Dhabi
 * Pay 38% in taxes (vs 0% in UAE)
 * Higher cost of living
* TC packages are generally much lower than US

The tool has a ""salary calculator"" where you input your current TC and it tells you exactly what you need to earn in another city to maintain the same lifestyle. Super helpful for negotiating relocation packages or evaluating remote work options.

Check it out: https://www.techcities.app

Built this with Cursor and Next.js.

Burned out software developer: what's next?,"As stated, I am a burned out software developer who have changed many developer jobs in the past 20 years. All of them ended up in the same toxic nasty situation which forced me to move on after 1 or 2 years.

I am an average Joe. Not smarter than most out there. I have a college degree in IT, but not exactly the cream of the crop which can land me a job with a competitive Big Tech. So I ended up in a series of jobs with IT outsourcing companies working on government projects as a contractor.

Well, initially I thought since I am a developer, I would be working on new development projects with new business requirements and new technologies. I was wrong. Most of the time, they are hiring developers to ""enhance"" or ""extend"" existing software systems, most of which were built with zero framework, discipline, consistency and coding guidelines. Quality is non-existent, and the software systems I inherited are flaky and crash-prone.

Whenever I join a new job, I would find out that the previous developer had ""left"" (aka fled) a few months ago, and there is no one to ask about the last status. The project manager would dryly tell me all the files and documents are in a particular laptop or PC that the previous developer or software engineer was last working on. ""So just go through the files in there and figure out where the previous guy last stopped,"" he/she would say. If I ask the manager anything, they would say, ""I have no idea. I am the manager, so I do not know the actual technical details. You're the engineer/developer who's hired to do the technical work, so go figure them out.""

And then the project manager would tell me on my first week, there's a upcoming deadline in 2 weeks or 1 month. Since the previous guy already left a few months prior, I would have to catch up on the lost time. And I have to make sure the thing works during user acceptance testing.

The project manager would then pass my mobile number to the clients or users, and then conveniently excuse himself/herself from all project meetings. They would just disappear, make excuses for not being able to attend meetings, and angry clients who are pissed with the constant project delays would call or email me directly everyday to chase for updates.

I realize later that what they are hiring are actually fall guys to take the rap, and slaves to toil unpaid overtime hours in an attempt to undo and redo the mistakes made by the past developers in order to deliver projects. When someone leaves, they would just ask HR to get some job applicants as replacement. I am tired of chasing project development milestones like a superman.

I have now given up hope that any developer/software engineer job would turn out differently. I am looking forward to a full time job that has stable hours, and predictable schedule for routine tasks, even if it pays lesser. I am now toying with the idea of looking for an IT support or application support job instead. Would a operations support role be more suitable to avoid nasty surprises?

Hourly Rate for Freelance Full-Stack Development?,"Hello all,

I'm a relatively young software developer, but I have been in the industry for about 3-4 years and have started my own company for doing contract-based software development on the side. 

I have a client that wants me to develop an inventory management system for them that will integrate with databases, azure services, and various other reporting systems. So not a terribly complex project. I have been told by the owner of this company that the project scale will continuously increase, so I've decided that hourly would be the best way to bill along with a charge for their database/domain/etc., but the hard part is deciding what should I charge? From research I've gathered on my own it seems like $60/hr would be fair, but I'd just like some second opinions. 

For reference, I live in SC and currently make just shy of $100k after bonuses and I've been promised a 30% raise this year by my boss and mentor who has been a great friend and I trust his word. Historically I am a very fast and efficient programmer, and I'd like to make sure I don't do an injustice to myself by charging too low per hour to account for my working speed.

should take a job in another country,"Hi everyone,

I’m at a crossroads and could use some advice. I just graduated from university with a major in Computer Science, and my dad has helped me secure a job in our home country. While I’m grateful for the opportunity, I’m worried about how this might impact my long-term career prospects.

My concern is that working in my home country, rather than starting my career in the West (like Canada), could make it harder for me to transition back later. My dad’s point is valid—there’s no guarantee I’ll land a job in Canada soon, especially since I don’t have previous co-op experience. I completely understand where he’s coming from, but I can’t shake the fear of getting stuck working in my home country. 

For context, I’d ideally like to work in software engineering, and I’m unsure whether starting in my home country will set me back compared to starting here in Canada, even if it means waiting longer to secure a role.

I'm stuck with what to do and I would love some advice.

"Deciding Between Help Desk, Research, and Capstone Options","I’m a double major in Computer Science and Digital Narrative and Interactive Design (focused on game design), with a minor in Information Science at Pitt. While I have a strong interest in technology and creativity, I’m still figuring out what my long-term goals are and what kind of career I want to pursue.

Right now, I’m trying to decide between three work options for this semester, balancing financial needs, academic requirements, and gaining experience. I already work a barista position that pays $28/hour for about 7 hours a week, and I’ve been working at the help desk as a student employee for my school for the past 8 months. I also have the opportunity to contribute to a research project studying the ability of dynamic reconfiguration to improve resilience under compound threats involving natural disasters and cyberattacks.

If I don’t use this research project as my capstone, I’d need to either secure an internship—which might be difficult at this stage—or complete two capstones (one for CS and one for DNID) simultaneously in a future semester. Here are the paths I’m considering:

1. First Option: Work at the help desk for about 15 hours a week at $12/hour and fulfill my capstone requirement by doing research, which is unpaid. It’s stable and lets me check off the capstone requirement, but it’s not financially ideal, and the research might feel more like an obligation than an opportunity.
2. Second Option: Split my time between working at the help desk for 10 hours a week at $12/hour and doing paid research for 10 hours a week at $20/hour. This option pays the most and lets me explore two types of work—help desk and research—but it could be overwhelming, and I’d still need to fulfill my capstone requirement later.
3. Third Option: Focus entirely on paid research, working \~12 hours a week at $20/hour. This option aligns with my academic strengths and could help me explore research further, but I’d still need to figure out the capstone requirement later, and it pays slightly less overall compared to Option 2.

What makes this decision tricky is that I’m not entirely sure which direction aligns best with my future goals. Should I focus on building technical skills, exploring research, or gaining broader experience? I’d really appreciate any advice or insights that might help me weigh these options and get clearer on what’s most important for my future.",deciding help desk research capstone options,im double major computer science digital narrative interactive design focused game design minor information science pitt strong interest technology creativity im still figuring longterm goals kind career want pursue right im trying decide three work options semester balancing financial needs academic requirements gaining experience already work barista position pays hour hours week ive working help desk student employee school past months also opportunity contribute research project studying ability dynamic reconfiguration improve resilience compound threats involving natural disasters cyberattacks dont use research project capstone id need either secure internshipwhich might difficult stageor complete two capstones one cs one dnid simultaneously future semester paths im considering first option work help desk hours week hour fulfill capstone requirement research unpaid stable lets check capstone requirement financially ideal research might feel like obligation opportunity second option split time working help desk hours week hour paid research hours week hour option pays lets explore two types workhelp desk researchbut could overwhelming id still need fulfill capstone requirement later third option focus entirely paid research working hours week hour option aligns academic strengths could help explore research id still need figure capstone requirement later pays slightly less overall compared option makes decision tricky im entirely sure direction aligns best future goals focus building technical skills exploring research gaining broader experience id really appreciate advice insights might help weigh options get clearer whats important future,0.4019,0.9964,positive,"['focused', 'strong', 'interest', 'creativity', 'kind', 'want', 'gaining', 'help', 'opportunity', 'ability', 'dynamic', 'improve', 'natural', 'secure', 'help', 'fulfill', 'stable', 'ideal', 'like', 'opportunity', 'help', 'fulfill', 'strengths', 'help', 'sure', 'best', 'gaining', 'appreciate', 'help', 'important']","['threats', 'disasters', 'difficult', 'tricky']"

A large career gap with a long story to go with it,"Story:

Before starting university, I had 3 published games under my belt, a great GPA from my community college, and I was set to attend one of the best universities in the U.S for computer science. The summer before my first quarter, my girlfriend since high school broke up with me. At the time, I didn’t think it was that big of a deal, but looking back, I realized how much it actually effected me

This is because once I entered my first quarter at my university, I completely fell apart and stopped caring about my future. This was the worst time to lose my drive because the workload at my university was 10x anything I’d ever experienced. It was designed for the truly determined. Dropping out when I knew my heart wasn’t in it would have been the right thing to do looking back, but at the time i felt that dropping out wasnt an option so instead, I pushed through by self-isolating and getting hooked on drugs where i used some very bad stimulants to pass my classes. I kept telling myself that ill get on the straight and narrow once i graduate but of course, that didn’t happen. 

After graduating in late 2022, I continued using for 2 more years until around 6 months ago, I finally decided to get sober. Since then, I’ve gone through a lot of self-reflection and discovered a genuine passion for software development and a genuine desire to want to work in the industry. I want to move on from minimum-wage service and use my degree, but with 3 years essentially lost, I feel like the opportunity has passed and that i essentially threw away my degree.

Recent experience:

I developed a portfolio website using React, i got a couple front end certificates from meta on coursera, a couple months ago i developed in python some blender addons that i sell on the marketplace, I participated in a few hackathons with some teammates and i have another hackathon coming up, I do leetcode problems everyday, and I apply to jobs everyday, after i graduated i published 2 games using Unity and C# and I half developed a vr game that i later scraped (I developed them on drugs so trust me the ones that i published are trash but all of my games, even the ones that i developed before going to my university, are original titles and nothing just came from a tutorial if that means anything). Im also in mid development of another game using Unity C# and Svelte/websockets but that wont come out for at least a few months.

Opportunities:

I have one with Revature, in which the unpaid pretraining starts soon but idk if i want to do it cause of how sketchy everyone says it is, and another as an unpaid web developer intern at an NGO. The NGO internship is 1 year long and there’s no opportunity for a permanent position. 

Question:

Should i take those opportunities? What should I do to get into the industry and get back on my feet?

Tldr: I graduated with a cs degree and after struggling with drugs for around 6 years i decided to get sober and ive been sober for 6 months. Recently i rediscovered a genuine passion for software development. I want to use my degree but feel like I’ve missed my chance. I built a portfolio, hackathon experience, some post-grad game projects, and upcoming opportunities with Revature and an unpaid NGO web dev internship.

"Need help with DSA, Competitive Programming and a bit with Life","Hi everyone! Hope you're having a great day :)

I'm making this post on behalf of my cousin brother. For context, we're residing **Indians**. He's in 12th class about to give JEE (M) in a few weeks. He's had a keen interest in programming since he was like 9 and has excelled in CS as a subject in school without any difficulties. He wants to get into competitive programming (college level competitions and all) and he will get a break after JEE (A) of a few months which he wishes to utilize by learning concepts which will help him achieve this target.

He's an academically motivated student, scores high and is consistent. Programming comes naturally to him, like he doesn't have to put in an effort to learn the code. He sort of understands what he has to do, and goes by it. He's eager to learn, is ready to take up a realistic challenge.

I've got a bunch of questions, and I'll number them. Whichever ones you guys think you can give a good input on, please mention the number and comment.

1. **The Stream:** He's currently thinking of Bachelor's Degree in Technology (Computer Science Engineering). But this is a field that's getting saturated, and he's afraid his future value might drop because of this. So, are there any other fields (like AI/ML) which would match his interests (computers and programming mainly)? And yes, he knows that he'll have to study a lot of theory, and he's had a look at the curriculums and is not dreaming a fictional dream. His goal is to align his interests with financial gain.
2. **Competitive Programming:** Now DSA is a really big part of this (along with other topics). The language he knows currently is only Python, but he's aiming to learn C++ as soon as possible. Then he wishes to study DSA. He's curious about it, and wants to win a few competitions in his college life (and help him with the studies during that time as well). He's confused on what path to follow on this journey. There are so many roadmaps and DSA sheets and he's puzzled on which one to follow, or if not to follow any of them. So, can you guys recommend how exactly to go by this?
3. **Dilemma 1:** Will doing all this really help him with college and job placements? Do competitions really matter to interviewers? Will he benefit from this?
4. **Dilemma 2:** This one's far sighted, but should he do a Master's Degree in this field? What doors does this degree open? A Physical Doctorate would be purely academic research, should he go for it?
5. Finally, anything you guys want to suggest him!

Thank you in advance to everyone who comments on this post. I'll coordinate your replies with him and take the conversation further.",need help dsa competitive programming bit life,hi everyone hope youre great day im making post behalf cousin brother context residing indians hes th class give jee weeks hes keen interest programming since like excelled cs subject school without difficulties wants get competitive programming college level competitions get break jee months wishes utilize learning concepts help achieve target hes academically motivated student scores high consistent programming comes naturally like doesnt put effort learn code sort understands goes hes eager learn ready take realistic challenge ive got bunch questions ill number whichever ones guys think give good input please mention number comment stream hes currently thinking bachelors degree technology computer science engineering field thats getting saturated hes afraid future value might drop fields like aiml would match interests computers programming mainly yes knows hell study lot theory hes look curriculums dreaming fictional dream goal align interests financial gain competitive programming dsa really big part along topics language knows currently python hes aiming learn c soon possible wishes study dsa hes curious wants win competitions college life help studies time well hes confused path follow journey many roadmaps dsa sheets hes puzzled one follow follow guys recommend exactly go dilemma really help college job placements competitions really matter interviewers benefit dilemma ones far sighted masters degree field doors degree open physical doctorate would purely academic research go finally anything guys want suggest thank advance everyone comments post ill coordinate replies take conversation,0.5267,0.9955,positive,"['hope', 'great', 'keen', 'interest', 'like', 'excelled', 'competitive', 'wishes', 'help', 'motivated', 'like', 'eager', 'ready', 'challenge', 'number', 'good', 'please', 'number', 'value', 'like', 'interests', 'yes', 'dream', 'interests', 'gain', 'competitive', 'wishes', 'curious', 'win', 'help', 'well', 'recommend', 'help', 'matter', 'benefit', 'want', 'thank']","['difficulties', 'ill', 'drop', 'hell', 'confused', 'puzzled', 'dilemma', 'dilemma', 'ill']"

The junior level is undoubtedly saturated: anyone trying to get their first job right now can attest to that. Mid level jobs are too.

How?? I don't buy the story that most engineers burn out and switch fields before reaching 5 years of experience. It makes no sense. 

Logically, the senior level should eventually become saturated too right? What do you guys think?

Junior dev looking for advice!,"Hi everyone,

I’ve just finished a year and a half working as a junior software developer for the same company. We’re a research institution handling a lot of tech prototypes, so I’ve had to juggle new technologies for every project we start.

While this has given me exposure to a wide range of tools and technologies, I feel like I haven’t been able to gain deep expertise in any specific language or framework. (It wouldn’t be the first time I’ve heard of someone in a similar situation struggling to change jobs because they lacked focused experience.) That said, I’ve gained a solid understanding of the bigger picture in projects, especially since I worked as a solo developer until fairly recently.

My experience so far includes backend and frontend development for various applications, managing code repositories, deployments, and configuring servers. However, I’m now looking to transition into cybersecurity, as this has been my goal from the start. I took my current role because I needed to secure my first job, but I’m now studying to earn certifications and make the move into cybersecurity.

At the same time, I’d like to change jobs. The salary at my current role isn’t great, and as the only person with knowledge of all of this , and also , I’ve been handling a lot of responsibility, which has led to burnout. I’m based in the EU and am also considering relocating, as the situation in my home country doesn’t look very promising.

I’ve been hesitant about changing jobs because I’m concerned about how the IT job market looks right now. On top of that, I barely have any free time between preparing for certification exams, work, and chores..

**Number of CS graduate:**

1. The number of cs graduate in 2022 is 108,503 for all university.  [Degrees in computer and information sciences conferred by postsecondary institutions, by level of degree and sex of student: Academic years 1964-65 through 2021-22](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d23/tables/dt23_325.35.asp).
2. The number of csgraduate from university is around 60,631. [Computer Science | Data USA](https://datausa.io/profile/cip/computer-science-110701)
3. On the same citation, doing the calculation, top 10 universities would produce around 10000 graduate per year
4. On average, the number of layoff was 200.000 employess during 2021, 2022 and 2023 according to layoff fyi

2. In May 2021 to 2022, around 180.000 people were hired software engineer while from 2022-2024, around 160.000 people were hired from 2023-2024.

3. The list is not exhaustive list, but only an approximate

Conclusion: taking in to account of being laid off and number of software engineer in US still growing, 180.000 software engineer job divide into different tier: entry, mid level and senior, I can see the ratio between new grad and number of posting is anywhere between 1 in 10 to 1 in 5.

How to escape 'sliver-handcuffs' with imposter syndrome,"Hey everyone, I need some advice. I’m 20 and just graduated with a computer science degree (first in my family to graduate college!), and I’m from a super small, rural town. I somehow landed a grad SWE role in a big city (still in my country), and the pay is more than my family’s ever seen before. For context, the median income (if converted to usd) here is around $36k, recent grads in SWE usually around $38k and I’m making $55k. I know that’s not huge (hence ""silver"") compared to tech salaries in more developed countries, but I’m super grateful.

Here’s the thing: I don’t enjoy the job much, but I *do* love being able to help my family. I’ve been using the money to help move us out of our rundown house, pay off debts, and just improve our lives. That part is amazing.

At the same time, I’ve got big ambitions and want to aim higher. But I keep feeling like I’m not even qualified for this job and just got lucky. If I quit, I’m scared I’ll lose this opportunity for good and end up in a lower-paying job that would wreck me financially and mentally because I don't want to go back to the old lifestyle ever again.

I want to job hop at 2 YoE. How to handle it?,"I currently have 1 YoE at a well-known, big-tech company. I plan to get an offer(s) at another big-tech company and leave after my stocks vest at the 2 YoE mark. I want to sanity check my plan here and see if 1. There are any holes in my plan, and 2. If there are any improvements that could be made to it.

  
My plan is as follows:

1. Finish Master's degree in June. This will be a benefit to some companies that prefer applicants with graduate degrees.

2. 1-2 months of interview prep until July/ August.

3. Start applying in August/September. Reapply in 3 months (November/ December) for companies that don't give offers on the first try.

4. If multiple offers, negotiate for highest possible salary, ideally top-of-band mid-level SWE. 

5. Accept the best offer for a January start date.

  
What I won't worry about:

1. Getting promoted at my current company. (Since I'll be focusing on finishing my degree/ interview prep, I don't think that I'll have the time to go above and beyond. My time would be better spent doing a fair amount of work, but dedicating my excess energy to the things that will allow me to jump to the next company).

  
Backup plan:

1. If I'm unable to get a mid-level offer at a new company, I will stay at my current company and try the following year (after the next stock vest).

Did my state university scam me out of an edu?,"TLDR: In my curriculum we barely wrote 12k lines of code, most people were cheaters, and i went entire semesters without coding. Is this the average experience, or did i get scammed?

Graduated in dec 2022 from a big 12 stateschool and i feel like i got scammed. My reasons include but are not limited to: how little coding there was, how little we applied any theory we went over, lack of rigor, and how much cheating there was...

I remember in 2020 when i was watching ""day in the life videos"" of other cs grads and when they talked about their courses it was so much more interesting than what i ever did in my courses. They talked about distributed computing concepts, making full stack apps in their sophomore year, implementing api's, using git as a class. Had no idea what any of this was and i just assumed ill eventually learn it in a class.

So let me describe my curriculum to give yall a better picture.

* First two programming courses were core java and java projects with old gui libraries. Most complicated thing was a game like minesweeper. Through out these 2 courses, i wrote a total of 2k lines of code. Yes i know loc is a bad metric to measure anything, but at the very least it gives some insight as to how often a beginner is  practicing and applying what theyve learned.
* c++ took as elective, no different than cs 101. Just basic control flow. No projects.
* Discrete math: Professor just relied on zybooks to teach it. Zybooks is an interactive textbook that does a poor job at teaching. Cant tell why, just that i spend more time ""gaming"" zybooks than learning whats required for the exams.
* Data structures in sophmore/junior year. Most professors taught this really poorly and required no more than 200 lines of code for entire class. I fortunately got a good professor that taught it well. 4 assignments all 600 lines of code implementing algorithms and structures and simulating stuff like social networks with graphs.
* Computor systems/architecture: took in summer, super hard. Beginning was coding in assembly, which was fun. No more than 1000 lines of code though. Rest was theory based questions and problem sets.
* Cyber systems. Was pretty bad dont even know where to begin. The prof and his research assistants were competeing with other schools to develop a vr system. Theyve already been working on it before the class even started and i guess this was supposed to be the focus of this class. The only people allowed to contribute to the development were Research assitants, TAs, and students with prev internship experience. This exluded most of the people including me and that left us with ""documentation"" and essays around HCI. Was bummed since i didnt get to code and learn anything practical.
* Database: The golden class that got me an internship and new grad job. Was hella good. We practiced sql, and ERDs extensively
* Networking: Only 2 basic fill in the blank assignment that i cant even remember. The class practically didn't even exists tbh.
* Mobile App: Was alright. Still rudimentary projects no more complicated than minesweeper. No Api development still, cuz know one knew what they were and no one taught us.
* software development: Only talk about agile and waterfall and ""soft"" skills. Essay based class. No coding.
* ""Computer ethics"": another essay based class.
* Math class (calc 1  through 3 + linear algebra) Damne good. According to friends who transferred from my school to elite school, the math here was as rigorous if not more.
* English classes, languages. No complaints, just that I hate writing.
* ""Automate theory""- was pretty good, covered 2/3rd of the famous MIT textbook.
* Numerical analysis  - Implementing functions in matlab and some hand written math. I didnt really learn anything. I just followed formulas and imlemented them. Different than my calc classes where there was more ""thinking"" involved.
* ""programming languages/compilers"" where we just wrote a handful of sorting methods in 10 different languages, and the final was a 6 page essay about functional vs object languages. This is senior year.
* ""operating systems"" where you learn a lot of theory about os and do a handful of rudimentary projects in c, using threads, mutex, processes, message queues. In total 6k lines of code for programming in this class. One of my favorite classes.

There was no ""distributed computing"" courses.



Now cheating:

  
In my final computer science class we had a simple C assignment where we just read in a csv file and did some minor calculations. 80% of class failed that assignment. Its like they couldn't transfer basic control flow from java to C. In fact, i don't think they even understood the basic control flow.Another example. Same class, different group assignment. I explained exactly what functions we needed to complete the assignment, but 2 teammates tried contributing to the code by writing all their stuff in the main function without testing to see if it works(it didnt) and tried pushing that code to our main git branch. The other 2 teamates, were so stuck they kinda just told me they dont know how to code and have been cheating since the intro course. Im by no means good at coding, but damn they make be feel like a genius sometimes. Is this the average experience?

I was also a tutor, so i met alot of students.

And cheating was everywhere.They dont know how to debug. If they have an error, they wont research it, at best they will just stare at it for hours, or theyll just continue writing code hoping that itll somehow fix itself.

People are graduating through group projects and mass cheating.

Edit: And if they fail, theyll complain that the course is bad, and the instructor will be forced to dumb down the assignments.

  
Is this the average experience, or did i get scammed?

* Filter the job sites for Data Scientist/ Data analyst/ SWE positions posted in the past week. 
* Apply to every position that makes sense.
* Message each company on LinkedIn with a brief introduction after applying.

Consequences about lying my GPA,"I’m currently a senior in college, and I recently received a referral from one of my parent’s friends who works at a major tech company.

"New Grad, 68k Offer","I've been lurking here for the past two years, and I was honestly pretty convinced I was cooked as someone expected to graudate in December 2024.

The only issue is that it's for 68k.

I'll admit, I was a bit heartbroken when I read that number on the offer letter, as I was expecting at least 80k based on the Glassdoor salaries alone.

But getting a software Engineering should give me an advantage to work as PM? Or I should just learn SQL and Phyton and that should be enough? Because I should do it to work and become a better PM but actually I don’t like the idea about coding but too if eventually I wanna make my own startup I’ll lack from technical (coding) skills.

So what I should to do?:
- do nothing, just learn SQL and some basic Phyton.
- learn coding on my own to eventually make my side projects technically possible on my own, plus ¿becoming a better PM?
- do software Engineering even If I’m not interested to work as SWE

Question About Upcoming Promotion to Frontend Team Lead,"**Background:** At a startup for the past 5 months doing mainly frontend work. The frontend was written by offshore devs and it was not great, so I've done an extensive amount of work in this time to optimize it - rewriting/refactoring enormous components (I'm talking 7k lines) into manageable components, implementing modern technologies such as React Query, Zustand etc.

**Current Situation:** My CTO isn't super strong on frontend and he has been impressed with my work and knowledge so he got me involved in hiring our newest frontend dev to help me out (we have a dev team of 12, 3 including myself are primarily frontend). Eventually he reached out telling me he was interested in making me the frontend team lead.

I am obviously really interested but I am a little wary about how to make sure I end up putting myself in a good position and not end up worked to death. I have been coding for 4 years (did a bootcamp), have a CS degree (did through WGU after being laid off, have another degree from UCLA as well) and 2.5 years of professional experience. The two other developers I will be overseeing both have more experience than me but seem more interested in the IC route.

**Compensation & Role:** I am currently making 110k which I know is low for how much work I've done so far but I was desperate after getting laid off and out of work for a bit. Given that I am making this amount now, how much should I ask for to be taking on more responsibilities as a lead? My CTO said I would basically be doing what I am doing now (mentoring/onboarding new hires, involved in hiring, deciding which technologies to use, troubleshooting difficult fe problems) but I would also be setting OKRs for the two devs under me.

**Question:** What are some good questions to ask in my upcoming meeting with my CTO and CEO?

Atlassian  vs Amazon,"Hoping someone w industry experience can help me out to make this choice. To say, I am very very grateful for the offers in this harsh market.

TLDR, which is SAFER?

They are both an internship, SWE for Atlassian and SDE for Amazon. I want to prioritize 1) RO rate for Full Time, 2) people and culture, 3) stability (if either even have any), 4) wlb > pay

I am a junior in college right now, so RO rate is most important for me.

i’ve accepted Atlassian and recently got Amazon so I’ll need to renege Atlassian if i choose Amazon. Not sure if it is a big deal tho (getting blacklisted?) Also, moving either of them to different season is not an option sadly.

Below are my intake from what i heard and researched. since they are both big companies, I think it’ll depend heavily on the department/team i’ll be at, but if anyone has any insight or advice on which is better for me, or simply which you will choose, please! I’m really grateful for anything 🥹 

———————————————

This may be controversial to my preference for a good wlb. I am an introvert but enjoy interacting with people, and the company i interned previously was remote friendly and many employees came to office about once a month, which kinda bummed me out as an intern (i understand the benefit it gives). This made me think if i prefer at least some in person as an intern/new grad. Wondering if Atlassian can be similar in experience? I think two companies are on the opposite end of this, with the recent RTO for Amazon and really remote friendly Atlassian.

I really value who i work with, more than the work itself or the benefits i get. I understand there’s a lot of luck involved for who i will work with, but hearing a lot of fuzzy stuff from both (especially for Atlassian lately), I wondered if anyone can comment on either regarding that. 

One thing that may matter is that I am thinking on living in Japan (where my parents are from) in mid-late 20s. Idk if i’ll get a job in Japan, work remote jobs and live in Japan, etc but thought having an option to internally transfer to a Japan office would be nice.

Should I go into CS or Mechanical/Electrical Engineering?,"Hello everyone, 

I would like to go to university and I've been thinking about CS a lot. I do like what projects like Linux stand for - free and open source software - and I do like finding out how things work under the hood. I also like tinkering (more of the physical tinkering - prying into stuff) and hardware.

However, I've never really been into software per-se. I do like using software, I'm not sure about creating software though. I feel like I'm not going to have the skill to be able to put something together.

The way I learn stuff is by creating a framework inside my mind with certain rules that apply and then imagining how something would behave inside that framework, which is why I'm not really comfortable when that framework changes (for ex.: I really like physics in this regard because the framework doesn't really change - it expands and encompasses the real world)

But that rejection above was different.

A good manager is empathetic. They craft their recruiting process with care, because their success relies on their team, and so they should spend lots of time and effort in creating this process. A manager that doesn't have the empathy to explain the general patterns of why many applicants got rejected, is a crappy manager.

Is Pursuing a Master’s for a Field Change from Data Analytics Advisable?,"I completed my Computer Science graduation in June, 2024. I have completed 3 internships amounting to period of 1.5 yrs, in Web Development and Data Analytics.

Currently, I am working as a Data Analyst in a Startup. But I have heard that Analyst field is not going to be booming out in near future, rather may slow down instead. So I was considering a change of field and thinking to do a Masters Degree thereby. I have sorted out these courses from different universities currently :

Applied Information Technology  
Information networking  
Information security  
Mobile and IOT Engineering  
Engineering and public policy  
Engineering and technology Innovation Management   
Supply Chain (Logistics)

Where do I put my focus? ,"To give some context: I’m a few years into my non-tech career (real estate private equity) and decided last year to transition for numerous reasons. I found I enjoy the concept of programming from following some tutorials and working on some minor things on my own.

I decided to get a second bachelors in CS and am now entering my 3rd semester (still working full time as of now). I feel this anxiety over me that I should be applying to internships and without them I’ll have a hard time transitioning from my current field to SWE.
I feel to even have a shot at landing an internship I need a portfolio of decent projects, and unfortunately I currently don’t have anything other than what I’ve done in class or from online tutorials. Secondly, I applied to a few internships and realized I’m not prepared for the online assessments they come with, so I’ve been studying data structures and the pertinent LeetCode-esque questions that may get asked. Given that I’m working full-time and will be taking 4 classes, I don’t know where my focus should be.

I can’t realistically build out projects so easily because I still don’t understand how to bridge the front end and back end yet, and so would need to dedicate time specifically to this. This would involve a lot more research on tech stacks, refining my html, css, JavaScript, etc. My concern is that if I shift my focus to that, I have less time to review the material for data structures (working on this with Python) that I may get asked on an online assessment. This is all while juggling coursework and work.

I guess my question to everyone with experience is, what’s my best path forward here? If I commit to full time school I can finish by the end of 2025 but at the risk of not landing an internship if I keep my current habits/ schedule.

Am I on an average CS career trajectory? Feeling stagnated. ,"I started working as a software developer about 3 years ago. Prior to that, I was working in education as a high school teacher. My salary in the Midwest has been as follows:

Y1 - 70k, bumped to 75k after 6 months.

Y2 - new company, started at 78k, bumped to 82k after \~6 months. (and just received a 1k holiday bonus).

Y3 - Still at 82k, verbally informed I will get another bump up after Feb.

I'm not trying to take away from their well-deserved achievements; I just wonder if I should be aiming higher. I've never actually tried applying to any top 10 tech companies.

Quitting my job once I get 2 years of experience,"For context I am nearly at the 2 year mark as a software engineer and usually after 2 years you get offered a full time position rather then a 2 year contract which is what I'm on now.

But there's a lot of reasons why I don't want to continue:

 - I'm really exhausted, my mental and physical state is also ruined due to having to commute 4 hours to get into the office and back home (I do it 3 days a week). Also I absolutely do not want to move to where I work because it's a dump with nothing to do there while I also want to prioritise saving money and living at home in my home city. Unfortunately the company hasn't provided any help in getting me a position in where I live (it's the biggest city in my country) or offering me more of a flexible hybrid schedule despite me asking for months.

- The second reason is I've had lots of personal problems arise due to my association with the company I work for and these problems have made me realize I absolutely don't want to work in the industry I'm in and I want to work elsewhere

Anyways my train of thought is I want to leave as soon as the 2 years are done because I have been applying for interviews else where but I'm so exhausted I don't have the time or energy to prepare for interviews at the technical stage. Not to mention when they hear I have to give a 3 month notice the tone of the interviewer changes quickly.

1. **Technologies and focus area:** Cybersecurity involves a lot of network-related work, which I really dislike. I can't see myself working with networks any longer than necessary. I'd like to continue using C++ but perhaps in a different sector. I'm also open to exploring other languages since this is my first job, and I feel it could be beneficial to experiment in different areas. I've heard that web development is quite saturated, though.
2. **No option for remote work:** Maybe it's specific to my current position or the broader sector, but due to security restrictions, remote work isn't an option for me. But, is on of my pivotal points to get another job, i work better from home.
3. **Possibility of emigrating:** One of the job requirements is being a citizen of my country, despite our work involving the EU and NATO. I'm not sure about my career progression in cybersecurity if I decide to move abroad—a decision I'm quite certain about.

On the positive side, the combination of C++ and cybersecurity seems to carve out an interesting niche that might offer a lot of job opportunities with relatively low competition. This makes it an appealing field to advance in without facing the common challenges of finding work in more saturated areas like web development.

Given these points, I'm reaching out for advice:

* Should I consider shifting from cyber roles while still using C++? Or is it better to take advantage of my opportunity to already be in the sector, get certifications, and continue in it?
* What are some potential career paths where C++ is heavily utilized outside of cyber?

Any insights or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated as I navigate these decisions.

LinkedIn Advice,"I never really liked LinkedIn, mostly because I find cringe and annoying.

I obviously have a LinkedIn profile which is up to date, but I'm almost never active on it and I made the dumb mistake of not connecting with a lot of people that I've worked with on the past (mostly because I wasn't actively using LinkedIn), so I have an embarrassingly low number of connections.

When I was in college, I mostly relied on college sponsored networking events which was to get internships and I got my current full-time job as a SWE at a reputable company as an internahip return offer.

I've been at my current job for ~2.5 years, I really like it there so I don't really plan on switching jobs anytime soon.

However, the horror stories I read online from the current job market scare me and I want to be as prepared as possible in case I get laid off. So, I'd like to increase my LinkedIn network more so that I can leverage it in case I have the need for it.

I'd rather do this now that I don't need a job instead of being forced to do this if I lose my current job.

Do you guys have any advice for my situation? 

Thanks!

Overthinking My Final Interveiw for a Junior Java Role ,"Hey everyone,
Sorry, I know this isn’t the usual type of post for experienced devs, but I desperately need the input of those who’ve interviewed candidates before. I applied for a junior Java developer position at my dream company, and the process has been intense.

Here’s the breakdown:

1. Stage 1: A 3-hour technical test on HackerRank – I passed.


2. Stage 2: A 1-hour HR interview – I passed.


3. Stage 3: A technical interview – This was 10 days ago, and I can’t stop thinking about it.



For the final stage:

They asked me about my CV, which I explained well.

Java-related questions came next, and I answered most of them confidently.

Then came a live OOP problem on HackerRank. I’ve heard they care a lot about seeing your thought process, but honestly, I didn’t vocalize much. I was mostly silent, just focusing hard on thinking through every aspect of the problem and trying to glue things together.

I froze a bit at times, and they had to ask me guiding questions (like reminding me to check what a function should return).

In the end, I successfully wrote the solution within the time limit, but my lack of vocalizing is what’s haunting me.



At the end, when they asked if I had any questions, I asked what I could improve. I admitted that I need to read prompts more carefully and mentioned that outside of an interview, I would’ve solved the problem faster.

They said results will come out in 2 weeks, so I’m expecting to hear back next week. But man, the overthinking is killing me. I keep replaying the interview in my head and wondering if being mostly silent during the problem-solving and freezing a bit is a red flag for them.

Does this kind of thing usually hurt someone’s chances for a junior role? Would really appreciate any insights or thoughts. Thanks!

I've been programming since the ages of around 10; I've had a very topsy-turvy intermittent learning progression through my years, though I've become highly proficient in Python, C and reverse engineering (on x86/64 architectures). I did what everybody suggests for someone like me that can't find work, that being freelance. I made a sizable amount of income for my age but then the partnership dissolved, since I didn't know how to continue the marketing side of the business.

Applying for software development jobs seems entirely futile, nevermind the degree requirements for most, I feel like I specialised in all the wrong places from an early age. The barrier of entry for positions that involve C tend to be very involved and complex, and Python is generally data-oriented or web-related, which I've never been interested in enough to learn. Same goes for reverse engineering, tending to be in the anti-cheat sector which is fairly competitive.

I have unsuccessfully applied for projects like Wine, whose preliminary tests I did pass, though did not end up on the shortlist, this being my only real experience for interviewing in this industry. On a completely separate branch, I highly enjoy teaching and have been doing so in my spare time for individuals that ask.

So where should I go? I love optimisation and high-performance systems and generally technical systems, I'm not sure if I should continue specialising in that field and hoping for something to turn up. Perhaps committing (no pun intended) more time towards open source projects like LLVM would go a long way?

"Master's in CS, with not much experience, Is It Too Late to Restart My Tech Career?","I am 27 (1997) have European passport, had degree in IT (bachelor) and masters in CS

I graduated in 2018, and worked for fall in cyber security company but without much success then went to US and got masters in CS. I messed up that I was speed running my degree instead of getting internships, hackathons and etc. 

So I graduate in 2021 I think and then I have no job offer, no one wants me without internship and that made me super depressed and I did some boot camp and got a random IT job at family friends company and coasted and wasted time while on OPT without doing anything productive and being depressed

2024 I moved to UAE due to family as my visa in USA has expired and worked in a family business company which is a waste of time and now have fights at work as how they interact with employees and conduct business 

Long story short I feel like wasting time and I feel sick to my stomach I got to 27, without doing anything in life, be no where in terms of career, dependent on parents support and being a bum

Now regarding CS I didn't touch anything for a year or two, not much resume experience and I don't even know where to live and what area to work at and which direction

Lost at life, can't ask my parents or friend as no one really knows what to advise and of course parents want me to stay in this mess to help but if business closes down I'm no one and homeless

Don't know what to do, I was thinking trying to do backend or learn full stack again but CS industry is on the low especially in UAE as they hire indians or Pakistanis on low salary barely survivable

Maybe try taking a major loan and become a pilot? I got FA license level 1 for football but as I don't have much academy experience in football I am behind in terms of football skills

"Not sure where to go next in my career, I feel stuck","TLDR: Older guy wondering if he should stay in programming or venture into new areas.

I'm an older guy (49) based in Canada and have really begun thinking about where I am and where I'd like to be. I'm not very happy in my current position but honestly don't know where I can or should go from here.

I've been employed in web development for over 25 years and at the same company for the last 18 of those. I started off using Perl for backend and swapped to PHP for the majority of those 25 years. My day to day work includes PHP, HTML, JavaScript, Flutter/Dart, and MySQL databases. None of that includes anything like Laravel/React/Vue/etc, it's all legacy stuff. Over 20 years ago I started a PHP forum open source project which still runs today (I am no longer involved) and that was some of the most rewarding time of my programming life - helping people. In my current career I mostly maintain really old legacy PHP projects specifically a CRM and more recently I brought our app development in house when I picked up Flutter/Dart a few years ago and update our apps for iOS and Android.

My current role is in a very small company, I am pretty much the only developer left as some have come and gone through the years. I have managed junior developers and even remote contractors in this time but as of right now it's just me doing any development. There are no prospects for advancement as well since there simply is no other place to go with the bosses being two brothers. Because of this size, my salary has remained pretty stagnant for the last few years with no increases in the last three years company wide. In the open source project I oversaw developers across the world and was the project manager for the last few years before I moved on.

So I am unsure of where to go or what to do as it's time. Time for me to move on and do something different. I, unfortunately, don't have any formal training. All my programming I learned on my own starting from BASIC when I was very young. I merely just have my work experience. I have not kept current due to my current role being legacy stuff so I can't easily swap to say a Laravel developer role which seems to basically double or triple my salary in some listings. Do I just put the time in and learn a new framework or language? Do I completely change careers? I am just really unsure right now but I feel stuck and it's a terrible feeling. I looked into project management jobs but most want certification so I'd need to dig into that (which I'm not opposed to at all of course) and looked into real estate as well.",sure go next career feel stuck,tldr older guy wondering stay programming venture new areas im older guy based canada really begun thinking id like im happy current position honestly dont know go ive employed web development years company last started using perl backend swapped php majority years day day work includes php html javascript flutterdart mysql databases none includes anything like laravelreactvueetc legacy stuff years ago started php forum open source project still runs today longer involved rewarding time programming life helping people current career mostly maintain really old legacy php projects specifically crm recently brought app development house picked flutterdart years ago update apps ios android current role small company pretty much developer left come gone years managed junior developers even remote contractors time right development prospects advancement well since simply place go bosses two brothers size salary remained pretty stagnant last years increases last three years company wide open source project oversaw developers across world project manager last years moved unsure go time time move something different unfortunately dont formal training programming learned starting basic young merely work experience kept current due current role legacy stuff cant easily swap say laravel developer role seems basically double triple salary listings put time learn new framework language completely change careers really unsure right feel stuck terrible feeling looked project management jobs want certification id need dig im opposed course looked real estate well,0.0772,0.9543,positive,"['like', 'happy', 'honestly', 'like', 'rewarding', 'helping', 'pretty', 'prospects', 'well', 'pretty', 'easily', 'feeling', 'want', 'well']","['unsure', 'unfortunately', 'unsure', 'stuck', 'terrible']"

Help choosing between two summer Internship offers as a Junior in college?,"Hey everyone, Happy New Year! I'm facing a dilemma with two internship offers for next summer, and I'd appreciate some guidance. Both offers are quite different from one another, and admittedly, neither is my top choice. However, each offers a unique set of skills, reputation, and most importantly, experience—which I don't want to turn down, especially in this market as a third-year college student. I’d love to hear other people’s opinions on which role I should choose and what you would do in my place. I’m still waiting to hear back from a few other options, but so far I have:

**Protiviti Technology Consultant role**

* Location: Chicago (I would love to spend a summer in Chicago)
* Compensation: $34/hr + $1,000 signing bonus
* Work model: Hybrid
* Duration: 8-week internship on a BPT team, with work ranging from software development and project management to data analytics and general consulting
* Prospects: High return offer rate with salaries between $90k-$100k—not too bad, in my opinion

**Cons:**

* I’m not entirely sure if a tech consultant role, even as an intern, would significantly elevate my resume or add substantial experience. Consulting is a vague field. Also, I'm not sure how valuable my ECE degree would be in this role.

**MetLife Database Engineering role**

* Location: Cary, North Carolina (a suburban area, but hybrid work)
* Job description: Enticing work with databases, data modeling, and data engineering using SQL/R. It seems like this could open more doors for me in the future, especially if I transition into big tech.
* My manager seems awesome, and we had a really good conversation during the interview.
* Compensation: $29/hr for a 10-week internship
* Reputation: Big firm name?

**Cons:**

* Uncertain about the rate of return offers
* I’ve heard not-so-great things about insurance tech in general, such as poor pay and work-life balance benefits.
* Potentially outdated tech stack?

As you can tell, there are some significant pros and cons for each role. My heart is leaning towards MetLife, but my brain tells me Protiviti is the safer choice regarding salary and work-life balance.

I haven’t ruled Computer Science out just yet, but I’m wondering about other viable career paths that involve computers and technology. Cybersecurity and IT are the only ones I can think of, and I’ll be completely honest, the latter doesn’t seem as appealing.

Negotiate pay bump for NYC,"Hi, right now I work remote as a software engineer, and my company wants to HQ to NYC. I'm doing some rough research on moving costs and median rents, as I want to prepare to ask for a salary increase and relocation package. Here are some key pieces of info:

* Current experience: 3.5 years out of undergrad. Been working at this company since July, and I like to think I'm doing pretty well
* Current comp: \~$140k/yr with 70bp equity on a normal 4 year vesting schedule. No health care or other bennies. 
* Company: early-stage startup that recently raised a big round. <10 people. Happy to share more over DM. Founders moving to NYC to try out in-person, and seem enthusiastic about helping current and future team members in relocating there. Pre-revenue but have a very long runway, so not exactly cash-crunched. 
* NYC: the company hasn't said where they want to set up shop specifically, but probably Lower Manhattan or Williamsburg (that's where most tech bros tend to flock these days). Personally I want to be able to have my own apartment that is less than 20 min away from the office and has in-unit washer/dryer. From some preliminary research it seems like I should be expected to be torching $3.5-5.5k/month. 
* Personally: I also want to make sure I have enough money to be able to invest and maintain my lifestyle which I think is reasonable - enough disposable income to play poker, buy healthy and whole foods, eat out and travel one in a while, and buy the occasional nice piece of clothing or toy/gadget. In other words, I don't want to have to make major compromises and be living paycheck to paycheck without any money to buy crypto or enjoy life. Also would be willing to give back some equity for some more cash for this to happen, if push comes to shove.

What's the best way to position this? ChatGPT said to shoot for \~$200-230k and $25k for relocation which seems high, but I'm likely:  
1) Underestimating my worth (imposter syndrome)

2) Underestimating how much shit costs in NYC and how much taxes are

3) Underestimating how much it costs to move to NYC (I'm halfway across the country) between moving companies, broker fees, and security deposits

  
I want to present my case that:  
1) I want this move to be as easy as possible. Previously I had a bad experience with a moving company.

2) I want to be able to be near the office and live a comfortable life so I can be at my most productive when I'm in the office 

3) In my 6 months with the company, I learned a lot about our codebase, industry/niche, and tech stack and am able to add even more value than when I first joined. 

4) If I was to give up some equity, it's not because I don't believe in the company but rather I need cash to live in this expensive concrete jungle!

Best Strategy For Finding a High Paying Job in 2024,"So right now I'm not exactly unemployed. I am working part time as a tutor for computer science and math, and I get a decent pay doing that. However, I do have a masters degree in computer science from OMSCS as well as 2 years experience as a data scientist. The problem is that it has been 5 years since I've had a full time job. It's a long story as to why that gap happened so I'd rather not get into it, but my question is, what should I do to prepare?

I've already shot out my resume to a bunch of recruiting agencies in Europe where I live. And I'm applying to machine learning engineer and data scientist positions on LinkedIn as I find them. Many of which it doesn't seem like I quite qualify for (they want 3 years + of experience).

I am practicing leetcode daily. I am also looking into kaggle, though I haven't started anything there. Since that looks easier than thinking up my own ideas for portfolio projects. Is this the right way to go?

One thing I worry about is finding a job that pays well. My previous position paid me about 70,000 usd a year, and that was before I had a masters degree. I feel like I should be getting at least that. But the trouble is that I live in Portugal where the pay for everyone is awful. It makes me think I should be getting ready to move somewhere else.

Any thoughts? I'm looking for general advice.",best strategy finding high paying job,right im exactly unemployed working part time tutor computer science math get decent pay however masters degree computer science omscs well years experience data scientist problem years since ive full time job long story gap happened id rather get question prepare ive already shot resume bunch recruiting agencies europe live im applying machine learning engineer data scientist positions linkedin find many doesnt seem like quite qualify want years experience practicing leetcode daily also looking kaggle though havent started anything since looks easier thinking ideas portfolio projects right way go one thing worry finding job pays well previous position paid usd year masters degree feel like getting least trouble live portugal pay everyone awful makes think getting ready move somewhere else thoughts im looking general advice,0.6369,-0.3146,positive,"['well', 'like', 'want', 'easier', 'well', 'like', 'ready']","['pay', 'problem', 'worry', 'trouble', 'pay', 'awful']"

If you are tenting a place or buying a car, you always look around to get a sense of what prices are in the current market.

This is also really important for the market for your skills. You should have a sense for what the market is. It helps your own decision making process. But also, it helps you answer requirements questions so you don't waste time and effort on something you would walk away from. (As a hiring manager, I appreciate this also.)

As a hiring manager at a good size company, I have the luxury to see what salaries people are accepting in different markets. I can ask peer manager to assess a resume to assess how a candidate compares to those.

"If junior jobs are harder to get due to gen AI automating their responsibilities, is it worth for juniors to learn to develop gen ai apps?","I've been considering looking to create a gen ai app to enhance my skills. I already got a diploma on software development which included co-op and self employment which was before covid lockdown happened.

But now due to the rise of AI and how hard it is to get an interview for junior level positions, it feels like my current skills as a programmer aren't good enough.

I think it makes sense to focus on learning to develop gen ai apps since a lot of companies are looking to switch to AI to get a lot of their stuff done.

However, i learned that creating a gen ai app is not exactly a junior level skill since it requires a deeper understanding of deep learning, NLP, and of course software development. There's prob a couple of things I have missed.

So let's say I take an online course that gives you the A-Z on building a gen ai app and you use it to create a couple of gen ai apps under your belt. Can pursuing this upskill your current programming skills to a higher level, or is it just equivalent to learning something new but without any professional experience in it?

I ask because early last year, I graduated cybersecurity and even got my az500, yet finding a job in that field has been extremely tiring, but I also realize cybersecurity is also not an entry level role too as it requires more experience.

"Spent 2.5 months unemployed and applying aggressively. Finally landed 2 job offers around the same time, here was my timeline and thought process if interested","Senior SWE with 8+ YoE, primarily .NET/Java/JavaScript/SQL. Was laid off in the fall, didn't waste much time before jumping back into the market. Routinely applied to places for .NET/Java remote jobs primarily through hiring.cafe but also some on LinkedIn (which has gotten far worse since the last time I used it years ago).

As I applied and interviewed I started to realize that being a generalist no longer cut it. Usually being a hybrid .NET/Java dev was a good thing for me but in this market I was always getting edged out by someone with slightly more .NET or Java on their resume. Especially for mid/senior level. I was really tired of wasting time in interviews where I was the afterthought candidate and someone else already had a better resume going in. So I re-tailored it. 

I had much more professional .NET than Java experience and made that clear on my resume. Started a .NET side project to fill in any gaps and learn some essential frameworks I hadn't worked with yet, added those to the resume as well and could speak to them. Basically did whatever I could to look more like a .NET specialist with JavaScript/SQL competencies, and exclusively spammed applications to .NET postings none of the other stuff. From there on out it was only a few more interviews and I had my offers.

tl;dr since companies have so many candidates to choose from now you want to be ""the best"", not just one of the distant possibilities. Refine your resume down to the exact tech ecosystem you are most familiar with, hone in on those kinds of postings and stop wasting your time on others.

Also not sure if anyone else has noticed but the entire world has learned Java at this point and you are competing with them too.

"As a junior web dev who is a carreer changer and in mid-30s, should I get a Masters in CS/AI or complete courses or just push myself to land a job asap?","**About:**

* An international whose native language is not English and whose English at B1/2
* Passionate about working in CS fields (especially development (ofc if it still makes sense in current AI era) )
* Non-CS but with a bachelor's and master's in STEM
* Mid-30s

**Goal:**

* To become an acceptable, competent and successful developer who remains relevant

**What I can document for CS** (web dev)**:**

* Full-stack web development bootcamp
* Many deployed projects on Github and in the portfolio
* A few certificates from platforms like codecademy, udemy

**Cons:**

* Current market conditions are very unfavorable, especially for juniors.
* Lack of any CS degree
* 0 YOE
* Age disadvantage for first-time hires in the field
* Improvements in AI are increasingly making juniors redundant
* Inability to integrate qualified AI solutions into projects due to lack of AI knowledge
* Inability to produce scalable solutions required by market due to lack of CI/CD knowledge

**Options** (one of them (or another one you will suggest) will be picked)**:**

1. Doing a master's degree in CS/CS&AI/AI to overcome some of the disadvantages in getting a job
2. Completion of coursera/edx/etc. courses on CI/CD & AI (optional additional .net backend)
3. Focusing completely on getting a job and start practicing asap

**Clarification:**

* The main reason I want to get a degree is my belief that it will increase my acceptance and make it easier for me to get a job. This may be wrong, as I said, this is just my opinion and I am trying to find out what is right/logical.
* The possibility of doing the degree on AI is not because I want to enter that field (as I said, I want to progress in the development field if it still has a future, CI/CD and AI will support this, according to the current options), but because I think that if a degree is to be taken for CS, it would be a better future investment.

**Thoughts:**

* For a master's degree program, there are courses such as math, statistics, data science, oop that I need to document on coursera/edx platforms and these courses can take 1 year in total. Likewise, since I am an international whose native language is not English, I need to give English proficiency, which will take at least 6 months. Master's degree also takes 2 years, another 1.5 years for admission requirements, and a total of 3.5 years for the degree. Considering the dramatic improvements in AI in months or even weeks, this seems too long and risky to jump into the market.
* I think finishing the platform courses is a plus to get more targeted and practical knowledge in a shorter time, but it is said that the most instructive content on CS/AI is in the masters degree, and this will make me a person without a CS degree in the long run, which will be a permanent disadvantage in job switches.
* If I choose Option 1 or Option 2, then I'm worried that I'll have to abandon my full stack web development practice, and if I spend time on that at the same time, the total time to get to the market will increase again.
* If I choose Option 3 and get a job (which seems very unlikely), I will have very little time to learn the stacks that the market expects but I don't have. This is a disadvantage in the mid and long term.

**Demand:**

What are your suggestions? If you advise me to give up the field completely, don't hesitate, I'm not here for consolation, I'm here to find a realistic way out. I'm really confused and I really need guidance from someone who works in the field or has experience.
