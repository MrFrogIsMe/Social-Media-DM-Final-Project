- applying to jobs immediately (filtering for past 24 hours postings everyday)

Are good software engineering practices sometimes at odds with job security?,"For example, avoiding tribal knowledge. You want all important details to be written somewhere so that no one needs to ask you. 

Automated tests, so that if someone breaks your code, they'll know where and why it broke without you having to tell them.

I had always assumed that making yourself unessential was a good thing because then it frees you up to work on bigger goals.

But in practice, this is not what I've seen. What I've seen in practice is that all managers really care about is how easy you are to replace. 

From personal anecdote I've seen older software engineers seem to understand this better and aren't as eager to make themselves redundant.

"Feeling Stuck and Lost: 4 Years of Experience, Former Amazon Engineer, but Can't Land a Job After a Year Off for Family","I’m in a very tough spot, and I could really use some guidance or words of wisdom from anyone who’s been through something similar. I’ve been grinding hard for months now—applying to jobs, prepping for interviews, trying everything I can to get back on track—but things just aren’t clicking.

Here’s some context: I’m a software engineer with about 4 years of experience. I’ve worked at companies like Amazon, and before that, I was in finance. My resume isn’t bad—I’ve led projects, worked with machine learning and scalable systems, done front-end and back-end dev, and even worked internationally. But despite all this, I’m barely getting interviews, and when I do, I end up rejected after what seemed like good recruiter conversations. It’s crushing.

The hardest part? I had to leave my job at Amazon about a year ago because my father was diagnosed with stomach cancer. I went overseas to care for him, and thankfully, he’s doing better now. But I’ve been job hunting for 6-7 months, and nothing seems to be working. It’s getting extremely depressing, and I’m terrified I’ll never find a new job.

I’ve shifted my focus to startups and YC companies because big tech feels like it only wants the “perfect candidate”—Harvard PhDs or people with a flawless, uninterrupted career path. But even the startups seem to want senior-level folks with a laundry list of experience for entry-level pay. It feels impossible to break in again.

And as if that wasn’t enough, I keep seeing articles about AI taking over jobs. I get it—we’re not there yet—but missing a year of work, dealing with personal responsibilities, and then seeing nothing but closed doors when I try to get back has left me feeling desperate and unsure of what to do next. Fortunately I have some more runway but NOT much left and it's getting scary. After having not worked for a year, seeing my peers and friends succeeding, it's hurting my ego and just making me depressed every single day.

Has anyone been through something like this? How did you keep pushing forward when it felt like everything was stacked against you? Any advice or guidance would mean the world to me right now.

Thanks in advance.

  
EDIT: 2 years finance experience, 4 years SWE experience, 1 year and 1 month of that was Amazon. The other years was at 2 different companies. You may ask why the hopping but for the 2nd job I had, there were layoffs which is why I then joined Amazon.

Engineers opinion regarding AI development is needed,"Yesterday another CEO (this time it was Mark Zuckerberg) said that AI would become capable of doing work of software engineers. In his opinion, starting this year we'll get ""AI that can effectively be a sort of midlevel engineer that you have at your company that can write code"". Personally, I don't believe it to be true as I worked with several LLM models and as far as I can tell they are far away from being ready to be called 'mid-level engineer'. But this is me speaking against Zukerberg. So it got me thinking. 

Most of the time when someone telling that ""AI will be able to replace developers"" its either some AI driven company CEO or marketing person, or it is some people very distant from software development, who tried it, managed to create a custom to-do list and now thinking that we are all cooked. But I doubt we can trust these opinions completely. 

So what do real engineers think? Are there any relevant and solid comments regarding the AI situation and progress from guys with experience in the field: actual senior or mid-level developers, those who do the coding and not the talking? Can you point me in the right direction where to look? 

Two reasons I am writing this. First, I need some experts opinion to show those who are learning or in the beginning of their career that everything is not that bad as it may seem. Second, I don't want to live inside a bubble. So I am trying to listen to different opinions and right now I see that the engineers opinions are missing from the picture.

"How do I ""disconnect"" from a client?","2 years ago I was hired by my current employer as a Senior Cybersecurity Architect, to work on a single project for a single client. That project will start to wind down then complete in 3-6 months and I'll start working with new clients. 


My problem isan emotional one. I'm far closer to my client's team than anyone at my employer. I meet with the client's staff 8+ times a week, work from their office (willingly) every week, hang out outside of work with our better halves. My employer on the other hand has me full ""WFH or any of the few dozen countries we have an office in"" and my work mates are solid but I see them in person once a month at most and there's a clear distinction between one group being work mates and the other messaging my phone for wedding photos the day I got married.

Almost all work friendships fizzle out within a year of the business relationship ending, I'm no stranger to that. Plus this project is a lot bigger than any other single point on my resume, it's a huge sense of pride. The client has tried to poach me but they can't match the pay, benefits, or career advancements, plus I'd serve the project better from where I am now.

And he's right. I've been doing engineering for 4ish years, and the 15 years of tech work before have been useful but don't really mesh with how they define senior engineers at his company.

So in all I'm pretty grateful. He says he'll go to bat and argue why an exception makes sense. But he could have said nothing. Brought me on to contract for 6 months then just shrugged when HR denied a full time offer.

Need advice for future job hunting - New Grad,"Hello everyone! 

I'm a Computer Science CO '24 student, us citizen, who has been looking for a job since around August, and wanted to get some advice regarding how to proceed.

In terms of experience, I had 1 internship in 2022 and another one right after graduation, but wasn't able to receive a return offer, as the second company didn't have an intern conversion program. I also have 3 college organizations listed on my resume where I worked with web development, and 3 projects listed on my resume.

I've applied to around 180-200 jobs: not that much compared to many people, I know, but I feel like it's genuinely difficult to even find jobs that I can apply for in the first place. Out of those, I had two final interviews, both which I did well on but was not selected. Now in 2025 I feel as if my status as a New Grad is rapidly vanishing and I need to overhaul my efforts at applying for a job.

Here's what I'm planning to do to try and secure any Tech-related job in the near future:

1. Acquire an AWS certificate (CPP, and maybe SAA if I gain more experience with AWS)

2. Apply to more government jobs (hell, jobs in general)

3. Work on newer personal projects and remove some older ones from the resume.

4. Maybe create a second resume I could use to tailor myself towards IT as well and get an A+ or Network+ certification if possible? Not sure if this is a good idea, because I don't have any IT experience.

Being put on a PIP 2 months after my Father died,"You heard that right, my father passed away in early November and I basically had to return to work 2 weeks later of those 2 weeks I was only paid 5 of those days for compassionate leave. So I had to force myself back into work while grieving. My performance took a nose dive as I honestly was not ready to continue working but had no holiday left nor could go on unpaid leave as I have bills to pay. So, from the last few weeks of November till end of December my performance wasn’t good, I couldn’t focus and the fact is no one really messaged me or spoke to me when I got back. No one said anything during the standup when I came back despite knowing what had happened. The only people that said anything to me was via a teams message which was from 1 senior dev and the head of QA which were appreciated. I just felt horrible and now coming into the new year 6th Jan I was put on a PIP. I couldn’t believe it. I’m looking for another job and will leave this place as soon as I can. This post is more to vent than anything just frustrated. Thanks for reading my misery.

How to land a web dev job from a degreeless Senior Engineer's perspective,"I've seen so many posts across all social media about how terrible the CS job market is right now. I can't speak for compiled applications positions but from a web development perspective it has never been easier [ *scratch that*, I should have said ""simpler"" ] to get a job. Notice how I didn't say it'd be fast? 

I've hired multiple people, owned my own development company, and led multiple projects as an employee. From the role of a hiring manager I can tell you that we absolutely positively do not care at all what your GPA was/is, what clubs you were in, or what your hobbies are. We care if you can achieve results. To further that point, I personally ( as do many of my peers ) not even care if you have a degree. I don't care if you can write a sorting algorithm with me watching over your shoulder because, guess what, that's not how we code in the real world. Use books, use Google, use ChatGPT. This field lives and dies on ""Get it done well and get it done fast"". How you do it is totally irrelevant. It's OK to ask for help and it's expected. 

So, if you're trying to get hired in 2025 here is my advice:

1. Trim your resumes way down to only reflect the absolutely most relevant information


2. Start a portfolio yesterday. Build things. It doesn't matter if they suck as long as they work. Now read that again. 


3. Ask EVERY. SINGLE. PERSON. you know if you can build something for them that'll bring value to them. Then put that in your portfolio. 


4. Stop getting degrees / certs in super oversaturated languages. Every person is coming out of college knowing Python. Pick an older language. Why older? Because tons of places still use old tech like PHP, Rails, etc. And guess what? It makes a lot of money because they need people to keep it alive. 


5. Quit applying to FAANG. Point blank...you aren't going to get hired. Instead, apply to non tech companies that need tech workers. Example: I was a Senior Full Stack Engineer for a commercial construction company. Six figure salary easy and in a rural state. 


6. Look local if possible. You can cut down on the competition IMMENSELY if you suck it up and take a work from office job local to your town / state. ( At least until you get a title and years under your belt )


7. If a company doesn't have their salary posted, it's probably a waste of time


8. If a company says you'll have more than 3 rounds of interviews...it's a waste of time. 


Remember, Actual completed projects are always better than what you say you know. 

And speaking of what you know..that's even less important than WHO you know. Make connections and make them often. Almost every job I've had, I've gotten because of someone I knew. 

That's my advice as a grumpy senior dev. If anyone has any questions, I'll do what I can to answer them as long as I don't get too bored. I genuinely do wish you all the best of luck though.

"This is the perfect time to start a business, instead of looking for a job","# DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT SELLING YOU ANYTHING. JUST HELPING.

I would like to talk about an alternative approach to the bad job market.

**I honestly think it is MUCH easier to build a business vs grinding leetcode and sending a billions job applications.**

I've done it multiple times and I'd like to offer everyone interested some help.

# ABOUT ME

I've never worked as a programmer in a company. I don't have a CS degree. I've never attended a bootcamp.

I am proof that ANYONE can learn this and build something.

I started learning at 25 and now, after 10 years and 10+ products, I can confidently tell you what works, and what doesn't... So you don't waste time and learn all of this in record time.

# BUILD BORING SHIT

This is the secret to making money. Businesses are **HUNGRY** for solutions to their everyday problems and they have nowhere to go.

Every developer is competing for the same FAANG jobs, and no one services the local businesses. Trust me, it is insane what they will tolerate.

To work at a company, you need to know a ton of tech, do politics, attend boring ass meetings, and beat 1,000 other applicants.

On the other hand, if you service local businesses, you can take a giant shit on the CEO's desk as long as you are helping him make more/save more money.

Your solutions don't even have to be anything special. The businesses are so desperate, they will be happy even with a mediocre solution.

NO ONE is offering them solutions, it is kind of amazing, you will have zero competition.

# FOCUS ON THE PROBLEM

If you follow this mantra, you will build great things. Do not try to come up with a smart solution and then sell it. Try to find what businesses struggle with, and then solve that problem. THEN you can sell that solution.

Problems are everywhere around you, you just have to listen carefully.

    Someone can say something mundane as ""Damn, I am so tired, I stayed late at work..."".
    
    Instead of saying ""Wow, that sucks..."", as ""Why? What made you work extra?"".
    
    They will say ""Man, I had to manually type in all this data"".
    
    You can then say ""Hmmm... I wonder if that can be automated...""
    
    Ask if you can have a look at the problem, or talk to some manager. Say that you can help them out.

The more boring the problem, the more interested they will be.

# IT'S ACTUALLY EASY

An amazing thing about building your own solutions is the freedom. You can build whatever you want, with no manager slowing you down. You are also free to choose the tech, so you are not forced to use shit tech like React, ORMs, Mongo etc... They client doesn't give 2 shits what your stack is.

This allows you to use really simple technologies to achieve the goal, instead of spending most of your time wrestling with tooling and needles complexities that you would encounter if you worked somewhere as a programmer.

# I CREATED A FREE GUIDE

I wrote a step-by-step guide and explained how everything works in order to build an app so you can start building solutions as soon as possible.

You can find it here: https://codepreneuring.com

Also, I have a 20 min talk on the same topic: https://youtu.be/YrRkAWDcMBE?si=zsfnTUA75JjWvhKp

I also plan to create Youtbe videos on various practical topics that most beginners struggle with. You can suggest some ideas what gives you the most trouble.

Should I Focus on Backend or Frontend Development as a Fresh Graduate?,"Up until now, in my university projects, I have only created desktop and CLI apps that handle a single user at a time. During this winter break, I decided to create a web app to learn how to build applications that handle multiple users. I also wanted to integrate the ML models I studied last summer. After researching, I took advice from GPT, which suggested learning FastAPI and React.js.

I recently completed a guided tutorial on FastAPI and explored the backend roadmap on roadmap.sh. I realized that I already know some of the concepts listed there, which sparked my interest in backend development. When I shared this with a friend, he mentioned that companies rarely hire fresh graduates as backend developers. Now, I’m wondering if I should continue focusing on backend development or shift my attention to frontend instead.

What do you think?

* Build real projects you can show off. Make something useful that solves a problem.
* Apply to jobs even if you don't feel 100% qualified.
* Intern at smaller companies since they're more open to hire new devs

My true CS story and a word of caution to those pursuing it,"I have a degree in computer engineering from a T25 with 2 internships.  My career progression has gone unpaid, 13/hr no benefits, 26/hr, 20/hr no benefits, 34/hr but now on track for layoff.  I'm 33 and only have 5 years of real work exp.  I have lived at home and lived cheap the entire time but yet haven't saved as much as my parents have spent supporting me to get here.  I've only just now cracked the 200K barrier but they have prob spent more like 300K to get me here. I have never been on a vacation or traveled, I get 6 days off per year, and my idea of eating out is a McDonalds McChicken with a free large fry loss leader coupon.  And again, I work from 9AM to 3AM multiple times a month.  

I am almost fully sedentary and asocial, and have developed late onset autism and schizophrenia due to the high cognitive load and stress of pursuing this career path.  At age 33, I'm setting aside the idea of ever starting a family or likely ever having real estate. 

After this layoff, due to a severe lack of jobs in my field for the foreseeable future, I will likely be looking at pivoting back to the same basic labor I could have done straight out of high school anyway and skipped all the costs and time waste of higher Ed.  It will likely pay somewhere in the $16-20/hr range for backbreaking work that I would have preferred to get out of the way when younger, and I will be shackled to living with family for the rest of my life. 

Due to the lowering of my testosterone and vocal ability (nothing to talk about combined with weakened vocal cords, since I'm at a computer mostly silent all day every day) due to having a sedentary computer job, most people find me socially repulsive and strongly dislike me within a few seconds of interaction.  I am frequently bullied even as an adult, and have even received physical threats verbally as well as direct threatening physical contact from coworkers.  This happens both in the workplace and when attempting to socialize.  I am friendly to everyone I come into contact with, but this is usually met with aggression.  

This is what STEM higher Ed study path sowed me.

I believe this is a realistic and common outcome of pursuing STEM as a career path.  Out of the dozen people I can think of that I've kept up with after schooling, only one other person has found a job paying above the 60K range.  Many of them never found anything and had to work 60-70 hours at a service level job or basic labor job to pay back their student loans, often while still living at home or with many roommates.  Only one of them has been able to start a family. I'm actually a success story compared to most of my peers because I didn't have the student loan debt. 

When doing simple searches for various STEM job postings on Indeed or LinkedIn etc  in my geographic area, over time I have noticed there are only a handful of applicable college-level jobs for STEM (or business, or humanities) grads every year, but there are known to be well more than 15,000 college graduates every year in the area. I would say the number is generously 2000 jobs for every 15,000 grads.  This is a trend I have been noticing since honestly 2008, as I frequently scroll job boards in my spare time.  The statistics that I have recorded for myself are wildly out of line with what is actually usually reported from the BLS and from higher Ed organizations.  

I recommend to do real data taking over your geographic region and seeing for yourself what you really think.  I think we are massively overvaluing the college degree currently and putting too much focus and time waste into it for our youth, leading to a detriment of their life outcome.

"for more experienced devs, is it better to be a jack of all trades, or a master of one? and is it feasible to be both? ","I’m 22 and in my last year of IT. I’ve completed about 18 freelance projects so far and worked for a company for six months on a contract to develop some things for them. I’m working as a full-stack developer using SQL, MERN, Next.js, and PHP. I’ve deployed projects on AWS, mostly using EC2 instances for hosting websites. I’m extremely good at frontend development and decent at backend development, though I can definitely improve. I’m also working on gaining more DevOps skills.

I have a small background in security; I took six months of courses on securing servers and web application penetration testing. I’ve also completed numerous web scraping and automation projects using Python. I’m really good at JavaScript, React and CSS a weird flex with CSS, but I’ve been able to recreate a ton of things with minimal Googling or AI assistance. It’s about 90% me writing the code. I’m also really good at finding bugs in full-stack projects; all my classmates would call me for help whenever they faced any CSS, JS, or full-stack-related issues.

Now, I’m trying to learn something more challenging, like C or C++, and create a complex project with it—maybe a game or a chess engine.

My current goal is to become a better full-stack web developer by significantly improving my backend skills, building a solid foundation in DevOps, and gaining more experience with it, if feasible. Additionally, I want to specialize in a specific field of cybersecurity, primarily securing servers or web applications.

The thing is, I believe web developers aren’t as respected as other developers, and I think there will be a lot of money to be made in other fields in the future. The problem is that I have no idea where to start or what to focus on to truly master. I feel like I’m spreading myself too thin.

I think fintech is great the money is great and I’m very passionate about software and coding in general, so let’s ignore the passion part.

Why are software jobs so incredibly unregulated?,"Part of the answer is that this is a relatively new career and some jobs don't actually require a degree but there are so many that build systems that handle money, run on airplanes and cars, power critical infrastructure, etc. But compared to jobs in law and medicine where degrees are obligatory or those in engineering where they are all but required as well CS is a wild west of people with questionble qualifications.

Small issue regarding internship and graduation,"Basically, I was originally supposed to graduate December 2025. I applied for JPMC SWE Internship through the CFG hackathon in the fall for the summer 2025 and got accepted around October.

I very recently had to make some changes to my degree as well as my graduation schedule so I will actually be graduating in May 2025 instead.

Onboarding doesnt start until late March, how likely would the recruiters rescind my internship if I email them right now about my graduation changes but still showing enthusiasm about participating in their SWE program.

Idk if this means much but imo, I made a really good impression at the hackathon as well.

I talked to a school career advisor and here is what they told me:

**""Definitely disclose your updated academic timeline to the employer; sooner is always better than later**

* **Go ahead and send an email to the recruiter (whoever you've been in contact with) and let them know that you want to “update” them on your educational timeline**
* **Advisor B affirmed that this is a good opportunity to re-emphasize your excitement. Additionally, you may want to express that you would be open to a longer-term role in the emerging talent software engineering program (linked below).**

**Advisor B also affirmed what I said yesterday in regards to this being a small adjustment that shouldn't cause you any issues since you did nothing wrong.""**

I guess I also wanted to know your opinions and was wondering if you guys have been in this situation or know of anyone who has been in a similar situation.

I dont have any other offers right now and yes, I'll obviously start applying for full time roles but it would be nice to have this as a backup until I find a better job.",small issue regarding internship graduation,basically originally supposed graduate december applied jpmc swe internship cfg hackathon fall summer got accepted around october recently make changes degree well graduation schedule actually graduating may instead onboarding doesnt start late march likely would recruiters rescind internship email right graduation changes still showing enthusiasm participating swe program idk means much imo made really good impression hackathon well talked school career advisor told definitely disclose updated academic timeline employer sooner always better later go ahead send email recruiter whoever youve contact let know want update educational timeline advisor b affirmed good opportunity reemphasize excitement additionally may want express would open longerterm role emerging talent software engineering program linked advisor b also affirmed said yesterday regards small adjustment shouldnt cause issues since nothing wrong guess also wanted know opinions wondering guys situation know anyone similar situation dont offers right yes ill obviously start applying full time roles would nice backup find better job,0.0,0.9856,positive,"['accepted', 'well', 'enthusiasm', 'good', 'impression', 'well', 'definitely', 'better', 'want', 'good', 'opportunity', 'excitement', 'want', 'talent', 'yes', 'nice', 'better']","['idk', 'wrong', 'ill']"
Considering a Move from Germany to the Bay Area as a Senior ML Engineer – Seeking Advice,"

Hi everyone,

I’m currently working as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer Consultant at AWS, based in Germany. My role involves leading ML projects for large international customer (mainly global corporations) and working hands-on, particularly with GenAI and other advanced ML solutions. 

Recently, I’ve been seriously considering a move to the Bay Area, driven by a combination of career growth and financial opportunity. After discussing with colleagues in the US, it seems that my skills and experience could command at least 2.5 to 3 times my current salary, which is a major factor. Beyond that, I believe working in the Bay Area could expose me to an even more innovative environment and help me push my career to the next level. I have a wife and also a child. (<5y)

I’d love to hear your thoughts:
	•	For those who’ve made a similar move, what was your experience like?
	•	How realistic is it to make such a transition, especially regarding visa sponsorship?
	•	What should I be aware of in terms of cost of living, work culture, and lifestyle changes?
	•	Are there specific companies, industries, or resources you’d recommend for someone with my profile in the Bay Area?

I’m excited about the possibilities but want to make sure I have a clear understanding of what to expect. Any advice, insights, or personal stories would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance for your input!

Am I pigeonholing myself into strictly data analysis positions or can I use the experience towards more development central positions in the future? ,"I accepted a position today as a data analyst for a local company because I need a consistent paycheck. This is the second job that I have had that is labeled as data analyst and/or IT. I am happy nonetheless because finding work has been difficult lately, but I am worried that I am setting myself up to be stuck in something I do for money and not passion.

The first big project I worked on ignited a passion in me that lead me to change careers. During my time taking prerequisite courses to pursue an additional masters (working towards now), I have been fortunate enough to work on a full stack project for a wholesale distribution side of a catering company. The problem is that I haven’t had work in any sort of development since then.

Am I in an odd position going forward? Should these positions be something I list on a resume, and if so should I be framing them in a certain light?

Struggling to Find a New Position: Seeking Advice on What I Might Be Missing,"Hi everyone

I’m currently facing challenges in my job search, and I’d like your input on what might be holding me back. Here’s some context about my background and experience:

I’ve held leadership roles, including Executive Director, Director of Sales and Marketing, and Regional Manager, where I consistently delivered exceptional results, such as improving gross margins, negotiating significant supplier savings, and leading high-performing teams. My skills include strategic vision, sales growth, and operational optimization. I also had roles such as project manager, product owner (not official roles but part of sub roles) and implementation manager.

Despite this track record, I’m finding it difficult to secure a new position. I’ve updated my resume, tailored applications to roles, and leveraged my network, but responses have been minimal.

I feel that the job market is somehow packed and that unless you have good connection it's becoming a lot harder to land jobs... (I'm from Canada and I apply in Canada as well as in the US) 

Also I do feel that being a ""jack of all trade"" is less attractive as I worked in SaaS, Eyewear retail and ERP world holding multiple position which maybe is seen as more volatile ???

Any advices ?

In October, I got a FAANG interview and landed a SWE Intern offer in November.

I immediately contacted my defense recruiter and tried to get my internship moved to off-season (FAANG didn't have this option), but she said it wasn't possible. I explained how difficult of a decision it was and how deeply sorry I was and reneged my defense offer.

It's 2 months later now, and I'd like to announce my FAANG internship on LinkedIn, etc. so that I can connect with other interns, find roommates, etc. However, I'm still connected with a lot of FT employees from the defense contractor due to the event, and I'm anxious about them somehow retaliating and calling the FAANG and letting them know that I had formerly reneged. Is this even a possibility, or am I just being anxious for no reason?

A not so popular “hack” for job searching,"Hey everyone,

I want to tell you about a “hack” for increasing one’s chances of getting an interview. Most people on reddit are focusing on tailoring resumes to pass ATS systems or using AI tools to generate cover letters or even bots that automatically apply to jobs for you. While all of these are useful, there’s one thing most people don’t even think about.

I guess most of you are aware at this point that most jobs get hundreds of applications nowadays. After filtering out the irrelevant ones, recruiters then go over the valid resumes and call people up for interviews. But here is the trick, they go over applicants in order, so if your resume is the last in the pile, chances are they are going to hire someone before even reading yours.

This means it’s important to apply to jobs as soon as they are posted. Most job boards (linkedin, indeed, dice etc) have filters that can display only jobs posted in the last 24h. Use that to make sure your resume is amongst the first ones in the pile.

Now don’t get me wrong, not all recruiters do it like this, but for those that do, this method actually works. How can I be sure? I’m working on an open source tool built around this idea. It aggregates jobs from 10+ job boards and sends email notifications when new jobs are posted so you can stay ahead of the competition.

Here is the link to the github project [https://github.com/beastx-ro/first2apply](https://github.com/beastx-ro/first2apply)

Before I get downvoted into oblivion: the tool also has a comercial version, I only made it open source recently. But seeing how this is a dev sub, I’m sure most of you can figure out how to run it locally.

What do people think about what Mark said? I’m a junior developer myself and have used LLMs (Large Language Models). I’ve read about many experienced developers who also use LLMs and can create a great product from scratch, as long as they have a solid understanding of development.

For example, if you’re a beginner, you can prompt an LLM with something simple like:  
*""Create this Product API for me.""*

If you have more experience, you can create more advanced prompts like:  
*""Create this Product API and include JWT and CORS.""*

Or if you’re working with SQL and forget the syntax:  
*""Make an aggregation for X so that it only returns Y result.""*

When it comes to frontend, whether it’s React or Vue.js, you can take a screenshot and prompt something like:  
*""I want this UI. Make it for me.""*

**Conclusion:** I can sense that there will be fewer and fewer hires of juniors/new graduates. Most companies will likely prefer hiring mid- or senior-level developers who have broad and solid knowledge and use LLMs to enhance their work and quickly deliver code so the product can hit the market faster.

P.S. Maybe now is a good time to create an MVP using LLMs and find an angel investor if the product has sales potential. There’s a Danish high school student who has done it, so perhaps we can follow in his footsteps.",rip junior future graduated dev mark said ai good mid dev opinion would like discuss yall,heres translated version english people think mark said im junior developer used llms large language models ive read many experienced developers also use llms create great product scratch long solid understanding development example youre beginner prompt llm something simple like create product api experience create advanced prompts like create product api include jwt cors youre working sql forget syntax make aggregation x returns result comes frontend whether react vuejs take screenshot prompt something like want ui make conclusion sense fewer fewer hires juniorsnew graduates companies likely prefer hiring mid seniorlevel developers broad solid knowledge use llms enhance work quickly deliver code product hit market faster ps maybe good time create mvp using llms find angel investor product sales potential theres danish high school student done perhaps follow footsteps,0.6597,0.9738,positive,"['create', 'great', 'solid', 'like', 'create', 'create', 'advanced', 'like', 'create', 'like', 'want', 'solid', 'good', 'create']",['forget']

How do I learn on a job with tight deadlines and unrealistic expectations?,"Background: I got hired in August at my first dev job as a junior dev, and this job is one of those 'fast paced environments' that is a standard 10hr day and drains you mentally - but it is a first job and bad job market so I've made my peace with that aspect for the time being and decided to tough it out.

However, my biggest concern is genuinely that I am not learning efficiently and I feel so stupid working here every day. I have been 6 stressful months into this job and while I have learned a lot, I am still given tasks everyday that I have no clue how to do.

For example, I will be given a task like ""Build this entire payment provider"". As soon as I get this ticket I am stressed and dreading it, because it will be given like a 3 hr 'estimate' (Sure it's an estimate but they get mad about overages and bring it up in quarterly reviews so I rarely log time over) and I know I am gonna have to find a way to build this thing out in their broken codebase that I still haven't wrapped my head around before the deadline for the ticket at the end of the sprint.

For me personally, I really need to break things down and isolate each part of it to understand/learn - but that feels unrealistic given the time estimates and the fact that I have tons of other tasks lined up in my sprint that I am confused about so I can't spend most of my day on one task allotted for 3hrs. So, what I end up doing is basically copying what I see in other places, reaching out to other devs for help, asking ChatGPT etc - whatever I can do to get the task done ASAP. Obviously while this tends to work, I am not learning by doing this and makes me feel more like a stressed out robot than a growing programmer.

What I used to do was get the tasks done during the workday, then spend hours after work studying what I did. However, this makes each day around a 14hr workday and just wasn't reasonable given that I was sacrificing the time I have for working out and taking care of myself to instead doing unpaid work.

So, how would you guys do it? Is this a matter of continuing to take the time to study after work?

TLDR: I can't seem to learn/work efficiently with unrealistic deadlines and expectations, and that is making me a worse programmer and stress out. So how do you guys do it?

An attempt of escaping academia at 30+,"Hi, 

I am not sure if this is allowed here, I am really just a bit desperate and looking for advice/opinion.

I mostly worked in academia and want to switch to data science in private sector in UK (or remote anywhere), but struggling to find a job in the field and start thinking it is due to me being hopeless.

So I am 34F, PhD in CS ( top10 UK uni), masters in maths in Russia (not as good uni though). My PhD was in computer vision with some data analysis and deep learning.

I worked in academia as a researcher (computer vision) and lecturing (maths,ds). Sometimes we collaborated with businesses.

I feel rather confident in python, ok with R, SQL, aws, have good knowledge in statistics, data analysis and machine learning. I also teach charltgpt courses as a volunteer.

I am applying for jobs (mostly via linkedin) but unfortunately not much has come up (applied for about 25, all that I thought I would fit into) and I only had one interview for a junior position that didn't go forward as they needed someone with more relevant experience.

So my questions really are:

1. Is it even possible with my initial conditions to do it?
2. If it is, what can I do to make myself a more desirable employee?
3. Are there any other roles that I can look into apart from DS that I am overlooking?
4. Does it make sense to lower my expectations and just start looking for internships?

"I’ve got a fantastic job, but I’m too dumb for it. What do I do?","Im a midlevel with 5 years of experience. I've been working for about half a year at this new company, it's a very big name (not quite FANG, but big splashy west coast tech), I'm paid VERY well, and I'm currently offered challenging work that's helping me grow.

It would all be great except I've been slowly realizing that I'm in over my head. It's like imposter syndrome but I'm actually really an imposter!

I do okay with the technical stuff; frankly not as good as I should be for 5 YOE but I'm growing fast and I feel good about that part. I can sure write some tidy, well-documented PRs that do what they say they do.

However, I struggle with... everything else. I'm given projects, and somehow I ALWAYS forget a detail... analytics, or communicating with another team that works in the area, or there's an edge case I missed, or it's hard for non-dev stakeholders to test, or there was a document I should have written. I really struggle with all the skills AROUND the actual coding.

Everyone works long hours, and I can't because I have a young family (my kid has been waking up every two hours a night for months now...) so I fall behind in that respect, too. This is a ""work hard and get the glory"" position, and I'm a ""do a reasonable amount of work, clock out on time, forget about work"" type. My boss is the political kind, he's definitely trying to make director, and he assumes everyone else is trying to make it big too. He tries to help me, but every meeting I have with him makes me so anxious because he's giving me advice for how to work in the middle of the night or on the weekend and I just can't leave my child alone.

If I can make it to a couple years here, I think my skills will grow massively and I can leverage that into a position that I'm a better fit for. I don't think I'm a terrible dev, but they openly state that they want the best talent in this job, and I'm not that. 

Two questions: how do I git gud at the non-coding aspect of the job?

Career advice - moving software engineering jobs for less money,"Asking for a friend as his Reddit doesn't have 100karma yet.

Hi everyone, bit of a long one but I was just hoping to get some career advice and input from you all.

I’m currently working as a fully remote (we don’t have an office) mid level software engineer in Australia for a medium sized US based company (still working AU hours as we have a small <20 person engineering team here down under). I’ve been here for about 3 years (started here as an associate) and have moved around different areas of the business so feel quite comfortable both with the people and with the tech stack here (React/Next frontend, node and AWS backend). The culture here is not bad but also not great. I won’t name the company but in the past couple of years, we’ve experienced numerous layoffs severely impacting both the headcount and morale. Stability wise I do think it’s getting better as we had new investors, repaid our debt and the new CEO and leadership team seems to have a strong people/tech focus. My direct manager is awesome and the team I work with is supportive whenever I reach out, although, I feel like most of them are checked out and jaded from the past several rounds of layoffs so I feel like they do the bare minimum on top of their day to day work (e.g. they don’t volunteer to do brown bag / lunch and learn sessions etc. but are willing to help out if you ask for help directly) and are just here for their pay check which I don’t blame them at all after everything we’ve gone through. So overall, I’d say the engineering culture is poor..

Recently, I’ve been offered another mid level engineering role at an Australian Digital Bank. It’s also a remote role with the option to come into the office whenever I want (will definitely come in more at the start to get settled in / make a good impression) but I do feel like they might change it to a hybrid structure and force people to come in (just a feeling based on how other Australian companies are treating their employees post Covid). The team I’ll be in will be working on a migration project so I’m not really sure what to expect there (some input here would be awesome). The tech stack for the backend is also quite different being Ruby on Rails and GCP (both of which I’ve never worked on). This does worry me a bit as I’ve mainly worked on the frontend and don’t have much backend experience so this might hinder my chances of getting promoted / getting a pay rise quickly. The culture and people seem pretty good from my interview experience and asking some friends of friends who work there, although they did mention that the culture is changing slightly as they are now in the scale up phase and growing quite large and quickly.

Now my uncertainty comes from (surprise, surprise) the pay… The new role will be paying an annual base salary $16k AUD less than my current company. They also don’t offer benefits such as health insurance, and internet, education and health and wellbeing (gym, sports etc.) reimbursements (the dollar equivalent of about $500 AUD/month or $6k AUD/yearly). On top of that, if I take the new role, I will miss out on my yearly bonus payout from my current company which I estimate to be around $10k AUD so all in all, about a $30k AUD remuneration difference. Also regarding the stability, as I have been working for around 3 years, if I do get laid off I should get a severance of about 3 months.

I would say I’m in the more junior side of my career as I’ve been a mid level for about 1.5 years. I value learning and growing my skills and currently, I feel like I can only do this on my own as like I mentioned above, everyone at my current company feels checked out so there’s not a great engineering or learning culture. I do feel like the people at the new role are much more optimistic and they put more effort into their engineering culture (e.g. they have mentoring programs, learning sessions and overall everyone seems less jaded lol). I understand that at the end of the day, I’ll learn the most from doing my own side projects but I feel like it would be good and nice to surround myself with more positive and eager engineers who like to share tech news, and interesting things they discover and are working on. 

One thing I have realised (and accepted) as well is that I don’t think any other AU company (with the exception of a couple of tech giants) will pay as much as my current company or provide as good of benefits as I joined when the market was hot and my awesome manager has always looked out for me throughout my time here. I have also tried negotiating the remuneration package and cannot delay my start date (to get my current bonus) for the new role.

So now I’m left heavily conflicted not knowing what to do. Should I make the jump and hopefully be surrounded by a new environment that can motivate me more or should I just ride out this current high paying gig which just lacks positive energy and can be depressing at times?

Why did we all fall for the CS degree scam?,"I've just started to realize just how useless this degree is now. Impossible to get a job. CS degrees don't teach you how to code, you're ""supposed"" to do that on your own. 

Companies don't care if you have a CS degree or not, they just care if you know how to code. I'm starting to realize why companies favored bootcamps back then, because if a bootcamp actually teach you how to code, it's more valuable than a CS degree. If it takes a CS grad 1 year to become productive, but a 4 month bootcamp grad is productive from day one, the bootcamp grad is more valuable.

There's a stupid amount of SWE's in FANG that don't have CS degrees. Why on earth did we fall for this scam? Why didn't we study electrical engineering or a ""regular"" engineering field.

Dropped because they used the wrong link.,"This is just me ranting. I just had an interview where I joined a call from the link I was given in our interview confirmation.

I emailed back immediately that I was in the call and did not see them. I even forwarded them the email with our interview confirmation that also had the link for our interview so they could double check if they were in the right interview as this was the only link I had been given. 20 minutes go by with me sitting in the interview room and they email me back that they were the ones using the right link and dropped our interview because we didn't have anymore time to meet today.

Should I stay another year to double major in Statistics? (B.S. in Computer Science),"Hi all, this semester I will be graduating with a B.S. in CS. As we all know, the job market is god awful, and even with internship experience I have had no luck in finding a job so far. I know it's still sort of early, but I truly feel like it's not going to get much better. I could finish a stats degree in two semesters if I were to stay an extra year. I think this would be good because my primary interests are in data science and machine learning (which is quite saturated too, I know). I was planning on doing an online masters in C.S. (spec in ML) but that would take at least 2.5 years for me to do, of which I don't want to be unemployed for. I have a 3.4 GPA, and would retake a course I got a D+ in to boost me to a 3.5 (that + the courses I'm taking this semester, of which I should get 4 As and maybe one B). I'd also be open to any careers that a stats degree opens me up to. I'm not sure if the new grad market is much better there or not, but I figured having a degree in both CS and stats would make me a more ideal candidate.

Optiver Behavioral Phone Call,"Hey!

Has anyone gone through this interview before and could you share the kind of questions they asked?

Also, if I were to pass this round, any tips on what the next rounds might involve and how I should prepare for them?
